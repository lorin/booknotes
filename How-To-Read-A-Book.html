<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You must know what kind of book you are reading, and you should know this as early in the process as possible, preferably before you begin to read. (p60)</li>
<li>State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most a few sentences (a short paragraph). (p75)</li>
<li>Set forth the major parts of the book, and show how these are organized into a whole, by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole. (p76)</li>
<li>Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve. (p92)</li>
<li>Find the important words and come to terms. (p98)</li>
<li>Mark the most important sentences in a book and discover the propositions they contain. (p120)</li>
<li>Locate or construct the basic arguments in the book by finding them in the connection of sentences. (p120) <em>Alternatively</em>: Find if you can the paragraphs in a book that state its important arguments; but if the arguments are not thus expressed, your task is to construct them, by taking a sentence from this paragraph, and one from that, until you have gathered together the sequence of sentences that state the propositions that compose the argument. (pp 129-130)</li>
