## Quotes

I have become convinced that universities are not devoted to the production and
distribution of fundamental knowledge in general. They are institutions
committed, for the most part, to a *particular* epistemology, a view of knowledge
that fosters selective inattention to practical competence and professional
artistry.

In my analysis of these cases, I begin with the assumption that competent
practitioners usually know more than they can say. They exhibit a kind of
knowing-in-practice, most of which is tacit.

Professionals claim to contribute to social well-being, put their clients' needs
ahead of their own, and hold themselves accountable to standards of competence
and morality. But both popular and scholarly critics accuse the professions of
serving themselves at the expense of their clients, ignoring their obligations
to public service, and failing to police themselves effectively. As one
observer put it, "the more powerful the professions, the more serious the
dangers of laxness in concern for public service and zealousness in promoting
the practitioners' interests."

Harvey Brooks, an eminent engineer and educator, argues that professions are now
confronted with an "unprecedent requirement for adaptability":

The systematic knowledge base of a profession is thought to have four essential
properties. It is specialized, firmly bounded, scientific, and standardized.

[Business case teachers use] carefully guided analysis of innumerable cases drawn from real
world business contexts in order to help students develop the generic
problem-solving skills essential to effective management.

Auguste Comte first expressed the three principal doctrines of Positivism.
First, there was the conviction that empirical science was not just a form of
knowledge but the only source of positive knowledge of the world. Second, there
was the intention to cleanse men's minds of mysticism, superstition, and other
forms of pseudo-knowledge. And finally, there was the program of extending
scientific knowledge and technical control to human society, to make technology,
as Comte said, "no longer exclusively geometrical, mechanical or chemical, but
also and primarily political and moral."

[Positivists] began to see laws of nature not as facts inherent in nature but as
constructs created to explain observed phenomena, and science became for them a
hypothetico-deductive system.

In the light of such Positivist doctrines as these, practice appeared as a
puzzling anomaly. Practical knowledge exists, but it does not fit neatly into
Positivist categories.

Practical knowledge was to be construed as knowledge of the relationship of
means to ends. Given agreement about ends, the question, "How ought I to act?"
could be reduced to a merely instrumental question about the means best suited
to achieve one's ends.

For according to the Positivist epistemology of practice, craft and artistry had
no lasting place in rigorous practical knowledge.

Indeed, it was from the Germanic tradition, carried to the United States after
the Civil War by young American graduates of the German universities, that the
new concept of the university as a multidisciplinary research institution took
root in the United States,

[T]he professions are to give their practical problems to the university, and
the university, the unique source of research, is to give back to the
professions the new scientific knowledge which it will be their business to
apply and test.

It was to be the business of university-based scientists and scholars to create
the fundamental theory which professionals and technicians would apply to
practice ... But this division of labor reflected a hierarchy of kinds of knowledge which was also a ladder of status.

[World War II's] lesson seemed to be this: If a great social objective could be clearly
defined, if a national commitment to it could be mustered, if unlimited
resources could be poured into the necessary research and development, then any
such objective could be achieved.

The medical research center, with its medical school and its teaching hospital,
became the institutional model to which other professions aspired.

But with this emphasis on problem solving, we ignore problem setting, the
process by which we define the decision to be made, the ends to be achieved, the
means which may be chosen. In real-world practice, problems do not present
themselves to the practitioner as givens. They must be constructed from the
materials of problematic situations which are puzzling, troubling, and
uncertain.


When professionals consider what road to build, for example, they deal usually
with a complex and ill-defined situation in which geographic, topological,
financial, economic, and political issues are all mixed up together.

[Professionals] are coming to recognize that although problem setting is a necessary
condition for technical problem solving, it is not itself a technical problem.

Problem setting is a process in which, interactively, we *name* the things to
which we will attend and *frame* the context in which we will attend to them.
