## Quotes

I have become convinced that universities are not devoted to the production and
distribution of fundamental knowledge in general. They are institutions
committed, for the most part, to a *particular* epistemology, a view of knowledge
that fosters selective inattention to practical competence and professional
artistry.

In my analysis of these cases, I begin with the assumption that competent
practitioners usually know more than they can say. They exhibit a kind of
knowing-in-practice, most of which is tacit.

Professionals claim to contribute to social well-being, put their clients' needs
ahead of their own, and hold themselves accountable to standards of competence
and morality. But both popular and scholarly critics accuse the professions of
serving themselves at the expense of their clients, ignoring their obligations
to public service, and failing to police themselves effectively. As one
observer put it, "the more powerful the professions, the more serious the
dangers of laxness in concern for public service and zealousness in promoting
the practitioners' interests."

Harvey Brooks, an eminent engineer and educator, argues that professions are now
confronted with an "unprecedent requirement for adaptability":

The systematic knowledge base of a profession is thought to have four essential
properties. It is specialized, firmly bounded, scientific, and standardized.

[Business case teachers use] carefully guided analysis of innumerable cases drawn from real
world business contexts in order to help students develop the generic
problem-solving skills essential to effective management.

Auguste Comte first expressed the three principal doctrines of Positivism.
First, there was the conviction that empirical science was not just a form of
knowledge but the only source of positive knowledge of the world. Second, there
was the intention to cleanse men's minds of mysticism, superstition, and other
forms of pseudo-knowledge. And finally, there was the program of extending
scientific knowledge and technical control to human society, to make technology,
as Comte said, "no longer exclusively geometrical, mechanical or chemical, but
also and primarily political and moral."

[Positivists] began to see laws of nature not as facts inherent in nature but as
constructs created to explain observed phenomena, and science became for them a
hypothetico-deductive system.

In the light of such Positivist doctrines as these, practice appeared as a
puzzling anomaly. Practical knowledge exists, but it does not fit neatly into
Positivist categories.

Practical knowledge was to be construed as knowledge of the relationship of
means to ends. Given agreement about ends, the question, "How ought I to act?"
could be reduced to a merely instrumental question about the means best suited
to achieve one's ends.

For according to the Positivist epistemology of practice, craft and artistry had
no lasting place in rigorous practical knowledge.

Indeed, it was from the Germanic tradition, carried to the United States after
the Civil War by young American graduates of the German universities, that the
new concept of the university as a multidisciplinary research institution took
root in the United States,

[T]he professions are to give their practical problems to the university, and
the university, the unique source of research, is to give back to the
professions the new scientific knowledge which it will be their business to
apply and test.

It was to be the business of university-based scientists and scholars to create
the fundamental theory which professionals and technicians would apply to
practice ... But this division of labor reflected a hierarchy of kinds of knowledge which was also a ladder of status.

[World War II's] lesson seemed to be this: If a great social objective could be clearly
defined, if a national commitment to it could be mustered, if unlimited
resources could be poured into the necessary research and development, then any
such objective could be achieved.

The medical research center, with its medical school and its teaching hospital,
became the institutional model to which other professions aspired.

But with this emphasis on problem solving, we ignore problem setting, the
process by which we define the decision to be made, the ends to be achieved, the
means which may be chosen. In real-world practice, problems do not present
themselves to the practitioner as givens. They must be constructed from the
materials of problematic situations which are puzzling, troubling, and
uncertain.


When professionals consider what road to build, for example, they deal usually
with a complex and ill-defined situation in which geographic, topological,
financial, economic, and political issues are all mixed up together.

[Professionals] are coming to recognize that although problem setting is a necessary
condition for technical problem solving, it is not itself a technical problem.

Problem setting is a process in which, interactively, we *name* the things to
which we will attend and *frame* the context in which we will attend to them.

Technical Rationality depends on agreement about ends.

It is rather through the nontechnical process of framing the problematic
situation that we may organize and clarify both the ends to be achieved and the
possible means of achieving them.

In the varied topography of professional practice, there is a high, hard ground
where practitioners can make effective use of research-based theory and
technique, and there is a swampy lowland where situations are confusing "messes"
incapable of technical solution. The difficulty is that the problems of the high
ground, however great their technical interest, are often relatively unimportant
to clients or to the larger society, while in the swamp are the problems of
greatest human concern.

Engineering that seems powerful and elegant when judged from a narrowly
technical perspective may also carry unacceptable risks to environmental quality
or human safety.

There are those who choose the swampy lowlands. They deliberately involve
themselves in messy but crucially important problems and, when asked to describe
their methods of inquiry, they speak of experience, trial and error, intuition,
and muddling through.

But for the most part, the use of formal models has proceeded as though it had a
life of its own. Driven by the evolving questions of theory and technique,
formal modelling has become increasingly divergent from the real-world problems
of practice. And practitioners who choose to remain on the high ground have
continued to use formal models for complex problems, quite oblivious to the
troubles incurred whenever a serious attempt is made to implement them.

They may use "junk categories" to explain away discrepant data, as technical
analysts sometimes attribute the failure of their recommendations to
"personality" or to "politics."

Nevertheless, Schein also believes that the problems of professional practice
continue to have unique and unpredictable elements. One of the hallmarks of the
professional, therefore, is his ability to "take a convergent knowledge base and
convert it into professional services that are tailored to the unique
requirements of the client system," a process which demands "divergent thinking
skills."

Schein, Glazer, and Simon propose three different approaches to the limitations
of Technical Rationality and the related dilemma of rigor or relevance. All
three employ a common strategy, however. They try to fill the gap between the
scientific basis of professional knowledge and the demands of real-world
practice in such a way as to preserve the model of Technical Rationality.

Our knowing is ordinarily tacit, implicit in our patterns of action and in our
feel for the stuff with which we are dealing. It seems right to say that our
knowing is in our action.

In his day-to-day practice [the practitioner] makes innumerable judgments of quality for which
he cannot state adequate criteria, and he displays skills for which he cannot
state the rules and procedures.

It is this entire process of reflection-in-action which is central to the "art"
by which practitioners sometimes deal well with situations of uncertainty,
instability, uniqueness, and value conflict.

Over the years, several writers on the epistemology of practice have been struck
by the fact that skillful action often reveals a "knowing more than we can say."

Barnard believes that our bias toward thinking blinds us to the non-logical
processes which are omnipresent in effective practice.

Chris Alexander, in his Notes Toward a Synthesis of Form considers the
knowing involved in design. He believes that we can often recognize and correct
the "bad fit" of a form to its context, but that we usually cannot describe the
rules by which we find a fit bad or recognize the corrected form to be good.

In examples like these, knowing has the following properties:
* There are actions, recognitions, and judgments which we know how to carry out spontaneously; we do not have to think about them prior to or during their performance.
* We are often unaware of having learned to do these things; we simply find ourselves doing them.
* In some cases, we were once aware of the understandings which were subsequently internalized in our feeling for the stuff of action. In other cases, we may never have been aware of them. In both cases, however, we are usually unable to describe the knowing which our action reveals.

But they may also reflect on practice while they are in the midst of it. Here
they reflect-in -action, but the meaning of this term needs now to be considered
in terms of the complexity of knowing-in-practice.

In each instance, the practitioner allows himself to experience surprise,
puzzlement, or confusion in a situation which he finds uncertain or unique. He
reflects on the phenomena before him, and on the prior understandings which have
been implicit in his behavior. He carries out an experiment which serves to
generate both a new understanding of the phenomena and a change in the
situation.

When someone reflects-in-action, he becomes a researcher in the practice context. He is not dependent on the categories of established theory and technique, but constructs a new theory of the unique case.

Although reflection-in-action is an extraordinary process, it is not a rare event. Indeed, for some reflective practitioners it is the core of practice. Nevertheless, because professionalism is still mainly identified with technical expertise, reflection-inaction is not generally accepted‚Äîeven by those who do it‚Äîas a legitimate form of professional knowing.

The dilemma of rigor or relevance may be dissolved if we can develop an epistemology of practice which places technical problem solving within a broader context of reflective inquiry, shows how reflection-in-action may be rigorous in its own right, and links the art of practice in uncertainty and uniqueness to the scientist's art of research.

In answer to the situation's back-talk, the designer reflects-in-action on the construction of the problem, the strategies of action, or the model of the phenomena, which have been implicit in his moves.

Drawing and talking are parallel ways of designing, and together make up what I will call the language of designing.

As they become more confident that they have achieved congruence of meaning, their dialogue tends to become elliptical and inscrutable to outsiders

In the medium of sketch and spatial-action language, he represents buildings on the site through moves which are also experiments.

Three dimensions of this process are particularly noteworthy: the domains of
language in which the designer describes and appreciates the consequences of his
moves, the implications he discovers and follows, and his changing stance toward
the situation with which he converses.

"A kind of garden" is not literally a garden, and the "soft back area" is not literally soft, but the metaphors of "garden" and "soft" are used to convey particular values of experience.

Aspiring members of the linguistic community of design learn to detect multiple reference, distinguish particular meanings in context, and use multiple reference as an aid to vision across design domains.

they are noting the implications of earlier moves for later ones, on the basis of a system of norms that governs the relative placement of major building elements.

As he reflects-in-action on the situation created by his earlier moves, the designer must consider not only the present choice but the tree of further choices to which it leads, each of which has different meanings in relation to the systems of implications set up by earlier moves.

In the designer's conversation with the materials of his design, he can never make a move which has only the effects intended for it. His

Thus the designer evaluates his moves in a threefold way: in terms of the desirability of their consequences judged in categories drawn from the normative design domains, in terms of their conformity to or violation of implications set up by earlier moves, and in terms of his appreciation of the new problems or potentials they have created.

The ensuing inquiry is a global experiment, a reflection-in-action on the restructured problem.

But whatever their differences of language, priorities, images, styles, and
precedents, they are likely to find themselves, like Quist, in a situation of
complexity and uncertainty which demands the imposition of an order.

What eludes him is the system of understandings which lies behind the
Supervisor's inquiry. When the Supervisor demonstrates what he takes as a story
sufficient for interpretation, when he focuses on certain details while leaving
others in the background, he appears to be guided by a repertoire of story
types, interpretive explanations, and psychodynamic patterns. He uses these but
does not describe them.

He reflects-in-action but he does not reflect on his reflection-in-action.

In both examples, the practitioner approaches the practice problem as a unique case. He does not act as though he had no relevant prior experiences; on the contrary. But he attends to the peculiarities of the situation at hand.

In neither example is the problem given. Or rather, the student presents a problem that the teacher criticizes and rejects.

The cases are similar in the further sense that in both architecture and psychiatry there are many competing views of the nature of the practice. There is controversy not only about the best way of solving specific problems, but about what problems are worth solving and what role the practitioner should play in their solution.

But the practitioner's moves also produce unintended changes which give the situations new meanings.

In this reflective conversation, the practitioner's effort to solve the reframed problem yields new discoveries which call for new reflection-in-action.

The unique and uncertain situation comes to be understood through the attempt to change it, and changed through the attempt to understand it.

In these instances, the practitioner affirms his refraining of the problem, because he values the unintended changes he has made and discovered.

Thus he judges a problem-setting by the quality and direction of the reflective conversation to which it leads. This judgment rests, at least in part, on his perception of potentials for coherence and congruence which he can realize through his further inquiry.

Thus the practitioner evaluates his experiment in refraining the problematic situation not only by his ability to solve the new problem he has set but by his appreciations of the unintended effects of action, and especially by his ability, in conversation with the situation, to make an artifact that is coherent and an idea that is understandable.

the practitioner also evaluates his reframing by its ability, in Erikson's phrase, to keep inquiry moving.

How can an inquirer use what he already knows in a situation which he takes to be unique?

It is clear that Quist and the Supervisor use a great deal of their experience and knowledge, and it is far from clear what might be meant by the spontaneous generation of a description.

What I want to propose is this: The practitioner has built up a repertoire of examples, images, understandings, and actions.
