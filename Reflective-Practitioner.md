## Quotes

I have become convinced that universities are not devoted to the production and
distribution of fundamental knowledge in general. They are institutions
committed, for the most part, to a *particular* epistemology, a view of knowledge
that fosters selective inattention to practical competence and professional
artistry.

In my analysis of these cases, I begin with the assumption that competent
practitioners usually know more than they can say. They exhibit a kind of
knowing-in-practice, most of which is tacit.

Professionals claim to contribute to social well-being, put their clients' needs
ahead of their own, and hold themselves accountable to standards of competence
and morality. But both popular and scholarly critics accuse the professions of
serving themselves at the expense of their clients, ignoring their obligations
to public service, and failing to police themselves effectively. As one
observer put it, "the more powerful the professions, the more serious the
dangers of laxness in concern for public service and zealousness in promoting
the practitioners' interests."

Harvey Brooks, an eminent engineer and educator, argues that professions are now
confronted with an "unprecedent requirement for adaptability":

The systematic knowledge base of a profession is thought to have four essential
properties. It is specialized, firmly bounded, scientific, and standardized.

[Business case teachers use] carefully guided analysis of innumerable cases drawn from real
world business contexts in order to help students develop the generic
problem-solving skills essential to effective management.

Auguste Comte first expressed the three principal doctrines of Positivism.
First, there was the conviction that empirical science was not just a form of
knowledge but the only source of positive knowledge of the world. Second, there
was the intention to cleanse men's minds of mysticism, superstition, and other
forms of pseudo-knowledge. And finally, there was the program of extending
scientific knowledge and technical control to human society, to make technology,
as Comte said, "no longer exclusively geometrical, mechanical or chemical, but
also and primarily political and moral."

[Positivists] began to see laws of nature not as facts inherent in nature but as
constructs created to explain observed phenomena, and science became for them a
hypothetico-deductive system.

In the light of such Positivist doctrines as these, practice appeared as a
puzzling anomaly. Practical knowledge exists, but it does not fit neatly into
Positivist categories.

Practical knowledge was to be construed as knowledge of the relationship of
means to ends. Given agreement about ends, the question, "How ought I to act?"
could be reduced to a merely instrumental question about the means best suited
to achieve one's ends.

For according to the Positivist epistemology of practice, craft and artistry had
no lasting place in rigorous practical knowledge.

Indeed, it was from the Germanic tradition, carried to the United States after
the Civil War by young American graduates of the German universities, that the
new concept of the university as a multidisciplinary research institution took
root in the United States,

[T]he professions are to give their practical problems to the university, and
the university, the unique source of research, is to give back to the
professions the new scientific knowledge which it will be their business to
apply and test.

It was to be the business of university-based scientists and scholars to create
the fundamental theory which professionals and technicians would apply to
practice ... But this division of labor reflected a hierarchy of kinds of knowledge which was also a ladder of status.

[World War II's] lesson seemed to be this: If a great social objective could be clearly
defined, if a national commitment to it could be mustered, if unlimited
resources could be poured into the necessary research and development, then any
such objective could be achieved.

The medical research center, with its medical school and its teaching hospital,
became the institutional model to which other professions aspired.

But with this emphasis on problem solving, we ignore problem setting, the
process by which we define the decision to be made, the ends to be achieved, the
means which may be chosen. In real-world practice, problems do not present
themselves to the practitioner as givens. They must be constructed from the
materials of problematic situations which are puzzling, troubling, and
uncertain.


When professionals consider what road to build, for example, they deal usually
with a complex and ill-defined situation in which geographic, topological,
financial, economic, and political issues are all mixed up together.

[Professionals] are coming to recognize that although problem setting is a necessary
condition for technical problem solving, it is not itself a technical problem.

Problem setting is a process in which, interactively, we *name* the things to
which we will attend and *frame* the context in which we will attend to them.

Technical Rationality depends on agreement about ends.

It is rather through the nontechnical process of framing the problematic
situation that we may organize and clarify both the ends to be achieved and the
possible means of achieving them.

In the varied topography of professional practice, there is a high, hard ground
where practitioners can make effective use of research-based theory and
technique, and there is a swampy lowland where situations are confusing "messes"
incapable of technical solution. The difficulty is that the problems of the high
ground, however great their technical interest, are often relatively unimportant
to clients or to the larger society, while in the swamp are the problems of
greatest human concern.

Engineering that seems powerful and elegant when judged from a narrowly
technical perspective may also carry unacceptable risks to environmental quality
or human safety.

There are those who choose the swampy lowlands. They deliberately involve
themselves in messy but crucially important problems and, when asked to describe
their methods of inquiry, they speak of experience, trial and error, intuition,
and muddling through.

But for the most part, the use of formal models has proceeded as though it had a
life of its own. Driven by the evolving questions of theory and technique,
formal modelling has become increasingly divergent from the real-world problems
of practice. And practitioners who choose to remain on the high ground have
continued to use formal models for complex problems, quite oblivious to the
troubles incurred whenever a serious attempt is made to implement them.

They may use "junk categories" to explain away discrepant data, as technical
analysts sometimes attribute the failure of their recommendations to
"personality" or to "politics."

Nevertheless, Schein also believes that the problems of professional practice
continue to have unique and unpredictable elements. One of the hallmarks of the
professional, therefore, is his ability to "take a convergent knowledge base and
convert it into professional services that are tailored to the unique
requirements of the client system," a process which demands "divergent thinking
skills."

Schein, Glazer, and Simon propose three different approaches to the limitations
of Technical Rationality and the related dilemma of rigor or relevance. All
three employ a common strategy, however. They try to fill the gap between the
scientific basis of professional knowledge and the demands of real-world
practice in such a way as to preserve the model of Technical Rationality.

Our knowing is ordinarily tacit, implicit in our patterns of action and in our
feel for the stuff with which we are dealing. It seems right to say that our
knowing is in our action.

In his day-to-day practice [the practitioner] makes innumerable judgments of quality for which
he cannot state adequate criteria, and he displays skills for which he cannot
state the rules and procedures.

It is this entire process of reflection-in-action which is central to the "art"
by which practitioners sometimes deal well with situations of uncertainty,
instability, uniqueness, and value conflict.

Over the years, several writers on the epistemology of practice have been struck
by the fact that skillful action often reveals a "knowing more than we can say."

Barnard believes that our bias toward thinking blinds us to the non-logical
processes which are omnipresent in effective practice.

Chris Alexander, in his Notes Toward a Synthesis of Form considers the
knowing involved in design. He believes that we can often recognize and correct
the "bad fit" of a form to its context, but that we usually cannot describe the
rules by which we find a fit bad or recognize the corrected form to be good.

In examples like these, knowing has the following properties:
* There are actions, recognitions, and judgments which we know how to carry out spontaneously; we do not have to think about them prior to or during their performance.
* We are often unaware of having learned to do these things; we simply find ourselves doing them.
* In some cases, we were once aware of the understandings which were subsequently internalized in our feeling for the stuff of action. In other cases, we may never have been aware of them. In both cases, however, we are usually unable to describe the knowing which our action reveals.

But they may also reflect on practice while they are in the midst of it. Here
they reflect-in -action, but the meaning of this term needs now to be considered
in terms of the complexity of knowing-in-practice.

In each instance, the practitioner allows himself to experience surprise,
puzzlement, or confusion in a situation which he finds uncertain or unique. He
reflects on the phenomena before him, and on the prior understandings which have
been implicit in his behavior. He carries out an experiment which serves to
generate both a new understanding of the phenomena and a change in the
situation.

When someone reflects-in-action, he becomes a researcher in the practice context. He is not dependent on the categories of established theory and technique, but constructs a new theory of the unique case.

Although reflection-in-action is an extraordinary process, it is not a rare event. Indeed, for some reflective practitioners it is the core of practice. Nevertheless, because professionalism is still mainly identified with technical expertise, reflection-inaction is not generally accepted‚Äîeven by those who do it‚Äîas a legitimate form of professional knowing.

The dilemma of rigor or relevance may be dissolved if we can develop an epistemology of practice which places technical problem solving within a broader context of reflective inquiry, shows how reflection-in-action may be rigorous in its own right, and links the art of practice in uncertainty and uniqueness to the scientist's art of research.

In answer to the situation's back-talk, the designer reflects-in-action on the construction of the problem, the strategies of action, or the model of the phenomena, which have been implicit in his moves.
