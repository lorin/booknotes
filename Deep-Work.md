# Deep work

## Notes

The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear
feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend
toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.

The first step of this strategy is to identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and your personal life.

### Rule #1: Work Deeply

People fight desires all day long

The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add *routines* and *rituals* to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.

Decide on your depth philosophy:

* Monastic (Knuth approach, sequester yourself for long periods of time)
* Bimodal (Jung approach, divide your time between deep pursuits and everything
  else)
* Rhythmic (Seinfeld approach, generate a rhythm, a regular habit)
* Journalistic (Isaacson approach, fit deep work wherever you can into your
  schedule)

*Ritualize*: build strict and idiosyncratic rituals. Should cover:

* where you'll work and for how long
* how you'll work once you start to work (e.g., no Internet, target # of words / 20 min)
* how you'll support your work (e.g., coffee, food exercise)

*Make grand gestures:* By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task.

Don't work alone:

* *whiteboard effect:* For some types of problems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if you were working alone.
* Distraction remains a destroy of depth
* even when you retreat to a spoke to think deeply, when it's reasonable to
  leverage the whiteboard effect, do so

Execute like a business

4 disciplines of execution:

1. Focus on the wildly important
    * the more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish
    * pick a small number of wildly important goals
2. Act on the lead measures
    * lag vs lead measures
    * time spent in a state of deep work dedicated to wildly important goal is
      a lead measure
3. Keep a compelling scoreboard
    * Author tracked number of hours spent in deep work
    * When reached an important milestone, he circled the tally mark
    * See his [blog post](http://calnewport.com/blog/2014/03/23/deep-habits-should-you-track-hours-or-milestones/)
4. Create a cadence of accountability
    * Rhythm of regular & frequent meetings of any team that owns a wildly
      important goal
    * Weekly review to plan for the work week

*Be lazy*

inject regular & substantial freedom from professional concerns into your day,
providing you with idleness pradoxically required to get (deep) work done

why?

1. Downtime aids insights
2. Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply
3. The work that evening downtime replaces is usually not that important

Support your commitment to shutting down with a strict *hutdown ritual* that
you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed:

* every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed
* for each one, either:
    1. you have a plan you trust for its completion
    2. it's captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is
       right

When done, have a set phrase that indicates completion (author says, "Shutdown
complete").

Author's shutdown ritual:

* takes a final look at e-mail inbox to ensure nothing requires urgent response
* transfer any new tasks on his mind or were scribbled down earlier in the day
  into official task lists
* quickly skim every task in every list
* look at the next few days on calendar
* make a rough plan for next day


Zeigarnik effect: incomplete tasks dominate attention

Adds an extra 10-15 minutes (or more) to workday.

### Rule #2: Embrace Boredom

Training addresses two goals:

1. improve your ability to ocncentrate
2. overcome your desire ofr distraction

#### Don't take breaks from distraction. Instead take breaks from focus.

Schedule the ocassional break from focus to give in to distraction. For
example:

Schedule in advance when you'll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogther
outside these times.

Suggestion:
* keep a notepad near your computer at work.
* on the pad, record next time you're allowed to use the Internet
* until you arrive at that time, no network connectivity is allowed

1. This strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet use and/or
   prompt email replies. Just schedule your next Internet blocks sooner (e.g.,
   every 15 minutes).
2. Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.
    * If you have to abandon an offline block, *chage* your schedule so your
      next Internet block begins sooner.
    * Enforce at least a five-mnute gap between current moment and next time
      you can go online.
3. Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training.
    * When scheduling Internet use after work, you can allow time-sensitive communication into your offline blocks (e.g., texting with a friend to agree on where you’ll meet for dinner), as well as time-sensitive information retrieval (e.g., looking up the location of the restaurant on your phone).
    * Outside of these pragmatic exceptions, however, when in an offline block, put your phone away, ignore texts, and refrain from Internet usage.
    * Key is *not* to avoid/reduce amount of time spend engaging in distracting behavior
    * Key is to give yourself plenty of opportunities throughout your evening to resist switching to these distractions at the slightest hint of boredom.

To succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable
resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn’t mean that you have to eliminate
distracting behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability
of such behaviors to hijack your attention.

#### Work like Teddy Roosevelt

1. Identify a deep task
2. Estimate how long you'd normally put aside for an oglibation of htis type
3. Give youreslf a hard deadline that *drastically reduces* this time.
4. Commit publicly to the deadline if possible.
5. Set a countdown timer on your phone and prop it up where you can't avoid
   seeing it

At first, try this no more than once a week. Then, incrase frequency.

You should be able to consistently beat the buzzer (or at least be close), but
to do so should require teeth-gritting concentration.

#### Meditate productively

*productive meditation*: take a period in whic you're occupied physically but
not mentally (walking, jogging, driving, showering) and focus your attention
on a single well-defined professional problem.

Goal: 2-3 sessions per week

Suggestions:

1. Be wary of distractions and looping
    *  Looping: avoiding diving deeper into the problem by instead looping over and over again on what you already know about it.
2. Structure your deep thinking
    * start with careful review of the relevant variables for solving the
      problem
    * store these *variables* in your working memory
    * define specific *next-step question* need to ansewr these variables
    * *consolidate* gains by reviewing clearly the answer identifieed

#### Memorize a deck of cards

* Memory training improves ability to concentrate
* Memory palace approach for deck of cards memorization:

In advance:

    1. Walk through five rooms in your house
    1. Fix in your mind a collection of ten large items in each of these rooms
    1. Establish an order in which you look at each of these items in each room.
    1. Add two more items, perhaps in your backyard, to get full 52 items needed
    1. Associate a memorable person/thing with each of the 52 cards
        * Maintain logical association between card and corresponding image
        * e.g., associating Donald Trump with the King of Diamonds, as diamonds signify wealth.

When the time comes:

* Begin mental wolk-through of the house
* As you encounter each item, look at the next card from the shuffled deck
* Imagine the corresponding memorable person or thing doing something memorable
  near that item (e.g., Donald Trump wiping mudd off of loafers on mat)

Doesn't have to be card memorization, andy structured thought process that
requires unwavering attention can have a similar effect


### Rule #3: Quit Social Media

*The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection:* You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it.



### Rule #4: Drain the Shallows
