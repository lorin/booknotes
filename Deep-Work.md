The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear
feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend
toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.

## Part 2: The Rules

### Rule #1: Work Deeply

People fight desires all day long

The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add *routines* and *rituals* to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.

Decide on your depth philosophy:

* Monastic (Knuth approach, sequester yourself for long periods of time)
* Bimodal (Jung approach, divide your time between deep pursuits and everything
  else)
* Rhythmic (Seinfeld approach, generate a rhythm, a regular habit)
* Journalistic (Isaacson approach, fit deep work wherever you can into your
  schedule)

*Ritualize*: build strict and idiosyncratic rituals. Should cover:

* where you'll work and for how long
* how you'll work once you start to work (e.g., no Internet, target # of words / 20 min)
* how you'll support your work (e.g., coffee, food exercise)

*Make grand gestures:* By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task.

Don't work alone:

* *whiteboard effect:* For some types of problems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if you were working alone.
* Distraction remains a destroy of depth
* even when you retreat to a spoke to think deeply, when it's reasonable to
  leverage the whiteboard effect, do so

Execute like a business

4 disciplines of execution:

1. Focus on the wildly important
    * the more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish
    * pick a small number of wildly important goals
2. Act on the lead measures
    * lag vs lead measures
    * time spent in a state of deep work dedicated to wildly important goal is
      a lead measure
3. Keep a compelling scoreboard
    * Author tracked number of hours spent in deep work
    * When reached an important milestone, he circled the tally mark
    * See his [blog post](http://calnewport.com/blog/2014/03/23/deep-habits-should-you-track-hours-or-milestones/)
4. Create a cadence of accountability
    * Rhythm of regular & frequent meetings of any team that owns a wildly
      important goal
    * Weekly review to plan for the work week

*Be lazy*

inject regular & substantial freedom from professional concerns into your day,
providing you with idleness pradoxically required to get (deep) work done

why?

1. Downtime aids insights
2. Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply
3. The work that evening downtime replaces is usually not that important

Support your commitment to shutting down with a strict *hutdown ritual* that
you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed:

* every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed
* for each one, either:
    1. you have a plan you trust for its completion
    2. it's captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is
       right

When done, have a set phrase that indicates completion (author says, "Shutdown
complete").

Author's shutdown ritual:

* takes a final look at e-mail inbox to ensure nothing requires urgent response
* transfer any new tasks on his mind or were scribbled down earlier in the day
  into official task lists
* quickly skim every task in every list
* look at the next few days on calendar
* make a rough plan for next day


Zeigarnik effect: incomplete tasks dominate attention

Adds an extra 10-15 minutes (or more) to workday.

### Rule #2: Embrace Boredom

Training addresses two goals:

1. improve your ability to ocncentrate
2. overcome your desire ofr distraction

#### Don't take breaks from distraction. Instead take breaks from focus.

Schedule the ocassional break from focus to give in to distraction. For
example:

Schedule in advance when you'll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogther
outside these times.

Suggestion:
* keep a notepad near your computer at work.
* on the pad, record next time you're allowed to use the Internet
* until you arrive at that time, no network connectivity is allowed

1. This strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet use and/or
   prompt email replies. Just schedule your next Internet blocks sooner (e.g.,
   every 15 minutes).
2. Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.
    * If you have to abandon an offline block, *chage* your schedule so your
      next Internet block begins sooner.
    * Enforce at least a five-mnute gap between current moment and next time
      you can go online.
3. Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training.
    * When scheduling Internet use after work, you can allow time-sensitive communication into your offline blocks (e.g., texting with a friend to agree on where you’ll meet for dinner), as well as time-sensitive information retrieval (e.g., looking up the location of the restaurant on your phone).
    * Outside of these pragmatic exceptions, however, when in an offline block, put your phone away, ignore texts, and refrain from Internet usage.
    * Key is *not* to avoid/reduce amount of time spend engaging in distracting behavior
    * Key is to give yourself plenty of opportunities throughout your evening to resist switching to these distractions at the slightest hint of boredom.

To succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable
resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn’t mean that you have to eliminate
distracting behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability
of such behaviors to hijack your attention.

#### Work like Teddy Roosevelt

1. Identify a deep task
2. Estimate how long you'd normally put aside for an oglibation of htis type
3. Give youreslf a hard deadline that *drastically reduces* this time.
4. Commit publicly to the deadline if possible.
5. Set a countdown timer on your phone and prop it up where you can't avoid
   seeing it

At first, try this no more than once a week. Then, incrase frequency.

You should be able to consistently beat the buzzer (or at least be close), but
to do so should require teeth-gritting concentration.

#### Meditate productively

*productive meditation*: take a period in whic you're occupied physically but
not mentally (walking, jogging, driving, showering) and focus your attention
on a single well-defined professional problem.

Goal: 2-3 sessions per week

Suggestions:

1. Be wary of distractions and looping
    *  Looping: avoiding diving deeper into the problem by instead looping over and over again on what you already know about it.
2. Structure your deep thinking
    * start with careful review of the relevant variables for solving the
      problem
    * store these *variables* in your working memory
    * define specific *next-step question* need to ansewr these variables
    * *consolidate* gains by reviewing clearly the answer identifieed

#### Memorize a deck of cards

* Memory training improves ability to concentrate
* Memory palace approach for deck of cards memorization:

In advance:

    1. Walk through five rooms in your house
    1. Fix in your mind a collection of ten large items in each of these rooms
    1. Establish an order in which you look at each of these items in each room.
    1. Add two more items, perhaps in your backyard, to get full 52 items needed
    1. Associate a memorable person/thing with each of the 52 cards
        * Maintain logical association between card and corresponding image
        * e.g., associating Donald Trump with the King of Diamonds, as diamonds signify wealth.

When the time comes:

* Begin mental wolk-through of the house
* As you encounter each item, look at the next card from the shuffled deck
* Imagine the corresponding memorable person or thing doing something memorable
  near that item (e.g., Donald Trump wiping mudd off of loafers on mat)

Doesn't have to be card memorization, andy structured thought process that
requires unwavering attention can have a similar effect


### Rule #3: Quit Social Media

*The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection:* You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it.

This approach ignores all of the negatives associated with a too.

*The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection:* Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.


#### Apply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits

The first step of this strategy is to identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and your personal life.

Authors goals:
 * effective teacher in the classroom and mentor to grad stduents
 * effective researcher

Once you’ve identified these goals, list for each the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal.

These activities should be specific enough to allow you to clearly picture
doing them. A good activity in this context would be something like: “regularly
read and understand the cutting-edge results in my field.”

Consider the network tools you currently use. For each such tool, go through the key activities you identified and ask whether the use of the tool has a substantially positive impact, a substantially negative impact, or little impact on your regular and successful participation in the activity.

Keep using this tool only if you concluded that it has substantial positive impacts and that these outweigh the negative impacts.

Example:

Personal Goal: To maintain close and rewarding friendships with a group of people who are important to me. 

Key Activities Supporting This Goal:

1. Regularly take the time for meaningful connection with those who are most important to me (e.g., a long talk, a meal, joint activity).
2. Give of myself to those who are most important to me (e.g., making nontrivial sacrifices that improve their lives).

*The Law of the Vital Few*: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.

#### Quit social media

Try stopping using social media for 30 days (don't tell people, just stop). After thirty days of this self-imposed network isolation, ask yourself the following two questions about each of the services you temporarily quit: 

1. Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service?
2. Did people care that I wasn’t using this service?

If your answer is “no” to both questions, quit the service permanently. If your answer was a clear “yes,” then return to using the service.

They’re just products, developed by private companies, funded lavishly, marketed carefully, and designed ultimately to capture then sell your personal information and attention to advertisers.

#### Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself

Put more thought into your leisure time.

Figure out in advance what you’re going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin.

Structured hobbies provide good fodder for these hours, as they generate
specific actions with specific goals to fill your time.

A set program of reading, where you spend regular time each night making
progress on a series of deliberately chosen books, is also a good option, as
is, of course, exercise or the enjoyment of good (in-person) company.

If you want to eliminate the addictive pull of entertainment sites on your time and attention, give your brain a quality alternative.


### Rule #4: Drain the Shallows

The shallow work that increasingly dominates the time and attention of knowledge workers is less vital than it often seems in the moment.

There's only so much deep work you can do in a day (1 hour for beginners, up to 4 hours for an expert)

Shallow work, therefore, doesn’t become dangerous until after you add enough to begin to crowd out your bounded deep efforts for the day.

#### Schedule every minute of your day

If your schedule is disrupted, you should, at the next available moment, take a few minutes to create a revised schedule for the time that remains in the day.

Almost definitely you’re going to underestimate at first how much time you require for most things.

*Overflow conditional blocks*: If you’re not sure how long a given activity
might take, block off the expected time, then follow this with an additional
block that has a split purpose. it. If you finish the activity on time,
however, have an alternate use already assigned for the extra block (for
example, some nonurgent tasks).

Be liberal with your use of task blocks. Deploy many throughout your day and
mae them longer than required to handle the tasks you plan in the morning.

Decide in advance what you’re going to do with every minute of your workday.

#### Quantify the Depth of Every Activity

*Shallow Work:* Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

Shallowness metric: How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?

#### Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget

For most people in most non-entry-level knowledge work jobs, the answer to the question will be somewhere in the 30 to 50 percent range.

#### Finish Your Work by Five Thirty

Author doesn't work after 5:30 PM.

He calls this commitment *fixed-schedule productivity*: fix the firm goal of
not working past a certain time, work backward to find productivity strategies
that allow him to satsify this declaration.

It takes a lot to convince the author to agree to something that yields shallow work.

In addition to carefully guarding my obligations, I’m incredibly conscientious
about managing my time. Because my time is limited each day, I cannot afford to
allow a large deadline to creep up on me, or a morning to be wasted on
something trivial, because I didn’t take a moment to craft a smart plan.

By ruthlessly reducing the shallow while preserving the deep, this strategy
frees up our time without diminishing the amount of new value we generate.

Any obligation beyond your deepest efforts is suspect and seen as potentially
disruptive. Your default answer becomes no, the bar for gaining access to your
time and attention rises precipitously, and you begin to organize the efforts
that pass these obstacles with a ruthless efficiency.

#### Become hard to reach

1. Make people who send you e-mail do more work
    * Make it harder for external people to find your email to reach out to you
2. Do more work when you send or reply to e-mails
    * *Process-centric* approach to email, minimizes number of emails you
      receive and mental clutter they generate. e.g., “I’d love to grab coffee. Let’s meet at the Starbucks on campus. Below I listed two days next week when I’m free. For each day, I listed three times. If any of those day and time combinations work for you, let me know. I’ll consider your reply confirmation for the meeting. If none of those date and time combinations work, give me a call at the number below and we’ll hash out a time that works. Looking forward to it.”
3. Don't respond
