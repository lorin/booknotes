# Drift into Failure: From Hunting Broken Components to Understanding Complex Systems

Sidney, Dekker

## Terms

complexity, drift, failure, broken part, Newton-Descartes, diversity, systems
theory, unruly technology, theory, rational, rational choice theory,
decrementalism, relationships

local rationality principle: people are doing what makes sense given the situational indications, operational pressures, and organizational norms existing at the time.

systems thinking is about relationships, not parts


## Outline

1. Failure is always an option
    - Who messed up here?
    - Rational choice theory
    - Technology has developed more quickly than theory
    - The Gaussian copula
    - Complexity, locality and rationality
    - Complexity and drift into failure
    - A great title, a lousy metaphor
    - Why we must not turn drift into the next folk model
2. Features of drift
3. The legacy of Newton and Descartes
4. The search for the broken component
5. Theorizing drift
6. What is complexity and systems thinking?
7. Manging the complexity of drift


## Failure is always an option

Features of complex systems

1. Complex systems can exhibit tendencies to drift into failure because of uncertainty and competition in their environment. Adaptation to these environmental features is driven by a chronic need to balance resource scarcity and cost pressures with safety.
2. Drift occurs in small steps.
3. Complex systems are sensitively dependent on initial conditions.
4. Complex systems that can drift into failure are characgerized by unruly technology.
