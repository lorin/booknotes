# Drift into Failure: From Hunting Broken Components to Understanding Complex Systems

Sidney, Dekker

## Terms

complexity, drift, failure, broken part, Newton-Descartes, diversity, systems
theory, unruly technology, theory, rational, rational choice theory,
decrementalism, relationships

local rationality principle: people are doing what makes sense given the situational indications, operational pressures, and organizational norms existing at the time.

Systems thinking is about relationships, not parts

Five concepts that characterize drift
    - scarcity and competition
    - Decrementalism, or small steps
    - Sensitive dependence on initial conditions
    - Unruly technology
    - Contribution of the protective structure

Banality of accidents thesis: incidents do not precede accidents. Normal work does.

## Failure is always an option

Features of complex systems

1. Complex systems can exhibit tendencies to drift into failure because of uncertainty and competition in their environment. Adaptation to these environmental features is driven by a chronic need to balance resource scarcity and cost pressures with safety.
2. Drift occurs in small steps.
3. Complex systems are sensitively dependent on initial conditions.
4. Complex systems that can drift into failure are characgerized by unruly technology.

## Features of drift

### Unanswered questions

Systems thinking is about relationships, not parts

System thinking is about the complexity of the whole, not the simplicity of
carved-out bits. Systems thinking is about non-linearity and dynamics, not about
linear cause-effect-cause sequences. Systems thinking is about accidents that
are more than the sum of the broken parts. It is about understanding how
accidents can happen when no parts are broken, or no parts are seen as broken.

### Outlines of drift

Five concepts that characterize drift
    - scarcity and competition
    - Decrementalism, or small steps
    - Sensitive dependence on initial conditions
    - Unruly technology
    - Contribution of the protective structure

### Scarcity and competition

This moved Langewiesche to say that Murphy’s law is wrong: everything that can
go wrong usually goes right, and then we draw the wrong conclusion.

### Sensitive dependency on initial conditions

Safety certification is about bridging the gap between a piece of gleaming new
technology in the hand now, and its adapted, coevolved, grimy, greased-down wear
and use further down the line.

### A Story of drift

This is the banality of accidents thesis. These are not incidents. Incidents do
not precede accidents. Normal work does. In these systems:

> accidents are different in nature from those occurring in safe systems: in this case accidents usually occur in the absence of any serious breakdown or even of any serious error. They result from a combination of factors, none of which can alone cause an accident, or even a serious incident; therefore these combinations remain difficult to detect and to recover using traditional safety analysis logic. For the same reason, reporting becomes less relevant in predicting major disasters.
