# Joint Cognitive Systems: Patterns in Cognitive Systems Engineering

Book by David D. Woods & Erik Hollnagel

A practical book.

This book is about how to inform the design of artifacts by taking into account how people
are likely to adapt to the changes they introduce.

Terms: 
* adaptability
* affordances
* alarms
* anomaly response
* artifacts
* automation surprise
* bumpable
* bumpless transfer of control
* cascading
* clumsy automation
* common ground
* coordination
* coupling
* demands
* dilemmas
* directed attention
* escalation
* functional synthesis
* hypotheses
* interpredictability
* joint cognitive systems
* narrowing, premature
* over-simplifications
* pattern
* reframing
* resilience
* shared frame of reference
* substitution myth
* tailoring
* tempo
* threads
* work
* workload
