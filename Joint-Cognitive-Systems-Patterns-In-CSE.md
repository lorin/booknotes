## Laws

### JCSs at work

Success in complex systems is created through work accomplished by joint cognitive systems (JCSs), not
a given which can be degraded through human limits and error.

p1

### Bounded rationality syllogism

All cognitive systems are finite(people, machines, or combinations). All finite cognitive systems in uncertain changing situations
are fallible. Therefore, machine cognitive systems (and joint systems across people and machines) are fallible.

p2

### No cognitive vacuum

There is no such thing as a *cognitive vacuum*. When we [as designers] create,
represent, or shape some experience for others, those people learn someting
[even if it is not what we intended]; form some model of explanatation [even if
it is not veridical]; extract and index some gist [even if itis quite different
from what was relevant to us]; see some pattern [even if we encoded other
relationships or no relationships at all]; pursue some goal [even if it is not
the goal we most value]; balance tradeoffs [even if our idealizations about work
push them out of our view].

p11

### Law of stretched systems 

Every system is stretched to operate at its capacity; as soon as there is some immprovement, for example, int eh form of new technology, it will be exploited to achieve a new intensity and tempo of activity.

p18


### Law of demands


What makes work difficult, to a first approximation, is likely to make work hard for any JCS regardless of the composition of human and/or machine agents.

p19

### Law of fluency

"Well"-adapted work occurs with a facility that belies the difficulty of the demands resolved and the dilemmas balanced.

## 1. Core activities and values

### Introduction

Four guiding values-authenticity, abstraction, discovery, participation-infuse the activities of Cognitive
Systems Engineering. WHen thes values are put into practice CSE discovers patterns in joint cognitive systems
(JCSs) at work, abstracts patterns in how joint cognitive systems work, and, ultimately, designs joint cognitive systems that work.

### Adaptability vs limits

The core ideas of CSE shift the question from overcoming limits to supporting adaptability and control.

The base unit of analysis is the JCS.

The key process to study, model and support is how people cope with complexity.

### Complementarity

Artifacts are not just objects; they are hypotheses about the interplay of people, technology and work.

### Core values of CSE in practice

* Observing work in context
* Abstracting patterns across specific settings and situations
* Innovating new concepts as hypotheses about what would be useful
* Participate in the struggle of envisioning with other stakeholders to create the future of work

CSE is concerned with how to transcend limits to authenticity in order to
capture how the strategies and behavior of people are adapted to the constraints
and demands of field of practice.

CSE confronts the *challenge of abstraction* to find and explain patterns behind the surface variability.

CSE is successful to the degree that it *sparks inventiveness* to discover new
ways of using technological possibilities to enhance work, to identify leverage
points, to seed development with promising directions, and to minimize negative
side effects of change.

CSE helps *create future possibilites* as participants with other stakeholders in that field of practice.

We are trying to understand how artifacts shape cognition and collaboration
given the organizational context and problem demands in fields of practice, and
how practtionres, individually and as groups, informally and formally, shape
artifacts to meet the demands fo fields of activity within the pressures and
resources provided by laarger organizations.

Practitioners adapt to work around difficulties and complexities, re-shaping
artifacts to function as tools to meet the demands of the field of activity.

### On systems in CSE

Systems perspective

* Interactions and emergence: relationships and interactions  across the parts
* Cross-scale interactions: multiple levels of analysis
* Perspective: parts of system and level of analysis are matter of perspective & purpose

Characteristics of artifacts and tasks interact to place demands on activities of and coordination across agents.

Characteristics of taks and needs for coordination across agents interact to specify how artifacts support work.

Properties of artifacts and agents interact to generate how strategies are adapted for work in the task domain.

Patterns in the intersections of people, technology & work:

* coordinated activity
* resilience
* affordance

users will develop many diverse models of the process or device and these models will be quite wrong.

### Patterns

References Christopher Alexander

### Summary

CSE is a systems approach to phenomena that emerge at the intersection of
people, technology and work. CSE draws on observations of JCSs at work; previous
general patterns are brought to these obesrvations; contact with work leads to
tentative abstractions about what patterns are present; this understanding
stimulates and guides the search for what would be useful to support the kinds
of work seen; these insights stimulate innovation fo design seeds in
participation with otehrs to support the work and processes of change.

CSE as a practice-centered research and design process, is generic but relevant.
It finds in the particular the existence and expression of universal patterns.
It tests and revises these patterns by seeing design concepts as tentative
hypotheses subjet to empirical jeopardy. These basic activities and values are
not contradictions or conflicts, but creative tensions at the root of
complementarity, harnessed for innovation.s


## Discovering patterns in joint cognitive systems at work

### Introduction

The study of joint cognitive systems in context is a process of discovering how
the behavior and strategies of practitioners are adapted ot the various purposes
and constraints of the field of activity. To study joint cognitive systems
requires going behind the more or less visible activities of practitioners to
uncover how these activities are parts of larger processes of collaboration and
coordination. The key is to uncover how people adapt to exploit capabilities and
workaround complexities as they pursue their goals.

### A JCS at work

Nuclear power control room training simulator. Observers discovered the operators acted
on unexpected changes in sound (system clicked when control rod system was active).

## 2. Joint cognitive systems adapt to cope with complexity


### Introduction

General patterns in cognitive work do not exist separate from particular
intersections of specific people, technologies and work activities. Hence, field
settings are more than unique domains or exotic fields of practice, but function
in parallel as natural laboratories where these generic patterns emerge. What
approaches would help us discover the essential patterns underlying the surface
diversity of people, technology and work? What techniques would help us begin to
unpack or partially ddcopose the complexities of systems of people, technologies
and work activities into meaningful parts and their interactions? How do we use
general patterns to guide cahnge and innovate new possibilities in concert with
other stakeholders? This chapter introduces the basics of how to shape the
conditions of observation, the consequences of the Law of Fluency, and the
central role of the Law of Deamdns in studying JCSs.

### Adaptation in joint cognitive systems at work

When new tech is introduced to field of practice, patterns of reverberations include:

* new capabilities, which increase demands and create new complexities such as increased coupling across parts of the system and higher tempo of operations
* new complexities when technological possibilities are used clumsily
* adaptations by practitioners to exploit capabilities or workaround complexities because they are responsible to meet operational goals
* complexities and adaptations that are surprising, unintended side effects of the design intent
* failures that occasionally break through these adaptations because of the inherent demands or because the adaptations are incomplete, poor, or brittle
* adaptations by practitioners that hide the complexities from designers and from after-the-fact reviewers who judge failures to be due to human error

Law of stretched systems

Law of demands

Law of fluency

### Summary: adaptations directed to cope with complexity

Studying and modeling a JCS at work requires understanding how the system adapts and to what it is adapted. The three guiding genralizations are the Law of Stretched Systems, the Law of Fluency, and the Law of Demands.


## 3. Being Bumpable: consequences of resource saturation and near-saturation for cognitive demands on ICU practitioenrs

A case study of cognitive system functions

starting point: model signfiicance of insiders' use of highly coded term of practice ("bumpable")

Cook uses bumpable term and a critical incident as wedges to:
* break through fluency of actual opperations
* uncover demands on work
* reveal hwo system has adapted to cope with these complexities

reveals adaptive power of ICU as a JCS

### The story: a delay

The case, which appears simple on the surface

A patient undergoing surgery needed to go to an intensive care unit when the
surgical procedure was complete. The surgical procedure was finished before the
intensive care unit bed was available, so the patient was taken first to the
recovery room and transferred to the intensive care unit after a few hours.


### The intensive care unit: the scene, the cast, and backdrop

### Coping with complexity: parcelling out beds by the bedmeister

#### Artifacts as tools: the bed book

#### Preparing for demand > supply situations: identifying *bumpable* patients

sometimes there is demand for an ICU "bed" that cannot be immediately accomodated

Responsibility of *bedmeister*  to assess patenits in ICU and select least sik patient for transfer to stepdown unit or the floor

A *bumpable* patient is one who is a candidate for transfer if an additional bed is required for a new patient.

#### Son of coping: building an ICU from scratch when no ICU bed is available

Potential crisis, may require relatively extreme measures

Use post anesthesia recovery room (PACU) or the operating room (OR) itself as an ICU

These approaches are expensive, disruptive,a nd severely limited


#### Piling Pelion on Ossa: escalating demands

When the ICUs are not full and there is a new demand for a "bed", the *bedmeister's* job is easy.

If the ICUs are full, the *bedmeister* function becomes more difficult and time consuming.

### Observations on the incident

The suggestion here is that practitioner argot points directly to the critical
concerns of NDM researchers. Because they sapn the distance from technical to
organizational, these terms capture the essence of what is going on and
therefore at the locus of the decisions/actions of practitioenrs. To explore
what it means to be *bumpable*, what a *bedmeister* actually does, what a
*bedcrunch* entails, what The Book actually does, is to explore the core of
success, failure, coordination and expertise.

## 4. Discovery as functional synthesis

### "Being *Bumpable*" as an example of studying a JCS at work


Being bumpable shows how modeling an ICU as a JCS leads to focusing on 
* what details to notice
* how to group them into a coherent description
* recognize what ICUs adapt around


Adaptations often become routines. Because of this, it is difficult for an observer to see how these routines are adpative and to what they have adapted.

Adaptations are not necessarily noteworthy to the practitioners themselves.

Discovery is aided by looking at situations that are:
* near the margins of practice
* when resource saturation is threatened (attention, workload, etc.)

See how the system stretches to accommodate new demands, and the soruces of resilience that usually bridge gaps.

Practitioner argot or terms of practice provide clues about how to meet the challenge of the Law of Fluency in order to discover what the system is adapted to, and how.

Terms often point to:
* informative relationships
* integrative judgments
* coordinative links
* responsibilities attached to roles

These:
* reveal the nature of practice
* missing from or under-emphasized in formal accounts of operations

Critical incidents: 
* useful to analyze as breakdowns or near-breakdowns in adaptation
* help in the discovery process
* useful heuristics for orgniazing and communicating the results across series of investigations that look into hwo the JCS functions

Recognizing an episode as a story of adaptation, resilience, and brittleness,
when it is otherwise not noteworthy or reflected on by participants, is a key
skill to develop as an observer of JCS at work.

The processes of workload management are central to the description (of ICU) as we hear of adaptations intended to cope with or avoid workload bottlenecks. 

Nevertheless, occasionally, as in the incident Cook captured, crunches occur.

Cook's synthesis shows how a resident develops a readiness to respond.

Functional analysis also captures how events cascade and demands escalate.

To recognize states (bumpable), roles (bedmeister), potential bottlenecks (bedcrunch), practitioner-created tools (The Book) is to engage in the process of **discovery** central to the study of JCSs at work.

### Insight and functional synthesis

Classic cases:
* Being bumpable
* How a cockpit remembers it speeds (Hutchins)
* Voice loops as key coordination tool in space shuttle mission control (Patterson, Watts-Perotti, Woods**

**Three characteristics of syntheses of how joint cognitive systems function:***

1. Power of observation
2. General patterns expressed in particular situations
3. Proposed functional account

#### Observation

Appreciate the significance of small details

Not all small details are significant.

Each study began with noticing the significance of what might be seen as just another detail:

* practitioner term "bumpable"
* demand on pilots to remember different speeds during a descent into an airport
* how space mission controllers listen in on voice communication channels



Investigators used starting point as a wedge to:
* open up the adaptive process
* reveal the nature of expertise
* identify basic demands/constraints that must be supported

Each study began with observers who were prepared to be surprised.

What forms of preparation are needed so that one can notice what they never expected to see?

#### Patterns

Preparation comes from using a pattern base built up through previous observation and abstraction across apparently diverse settings.

Observer constantly asks:
* What is this activity an example of?
* Have we seen this before?
* How does this both fit and differ from patterns in the research base?

Role of preparation for surprise in the process observation is another case of Neisser's perceptual cycle where ther is an interplay between calling to mind general knowledge about JCSs at work and observing specific JCSs working.

The skill is a general one not only in studying JCSs, but in science and in diagnosis-using concepts to see beyond the surface variability without being trapped into seeing only those concepts.


Warrent for patterns comes from several sources:

1. claims to authenticity in the set of observations
2. matches (or mistmatches) to the patterns noted in the previous studies in this setting and to the JCS themes invoked

Is it:
* confirming
* expandinging
* modifying
* overturning
generic patterns?

#### Functional account

Each study provides a coherent account: goes below the surface to propose deepr dynamics.

Account / candidate functional explanation about how behvior is adapted to constraints and goals

Sharing observations, patterns, and functional accounts refers to making the accounts and their basis in observations explicit and accessible.

What is striking in the trio of studies as functional accounts is insight.

## 5. Shaping the conditions of observations

The laws of demands and fluency capture the significant difficulties that once
faces in studying JCSs at work. How does one break through the current web of
adaptationto understand the underlying demands and to anticipate/guide future
processes of cahnge and adptation? Without this understanding processes of
changes are exercises in slow trial and error despite the extravagant claims of
technology advocates.

Effective methods for studying JCSs at work disrupt and disturb the current system to observe how that system adapts and settles back into equilibrium.

Different ways of carrying this out:

1. Observing at naturally occurring points of change (e.g., observe side effects of introducing new IT)
1. Reconstructing the run up to accidents and incidents since these breakdowns reveal the adaptive limits of the JCS
1. Introducing probe events at the suspected boundaries of the current system to force adaptive behavior into the open.
1. Changing the artifacts available for use in handling situations.


First two approaches are natural history (in situ) techniques.

Second two approaches are staged or scaled world techniques.

Natural history techniques help design problems by identifying situations that present demands and dilemmas.



### Three families of methods that vary in shaping conditions of observation

Three classes of research methods:

* Natural history methods (in situ)
* Experiments-in-the-field: staged or scaled worlds
* Spartan lab experiments: experimenter-created artificial tasks

#### Natural history

The natural history observer is listening to, eliciting, and collecting stories of practice

Building up a corpus of cases is fundamental.

Natural History begins with the analysis of the structure or process of each case observed. Results are then compared/contrasted across otehr analyzed cases.

* What patterns and themes in JCSs at work appear to play out in this setting?
* What kind of natural laboratory is this or could this be?


Natural History methods critical constraint: observers have to wait for what happens

By shaping the conditions of observation, we can seek to increase the chances or frequency of encounter of the themes of interest.

Very often, eliciting & finding stories of challenge/response in practice is a retrospective process in that the stories collected have already occurred.

Limits of retrospective accounts are balanced when:
* one builds a corpus of related cases, and
* one is able to collect multiple participants' accounts of teh challenge/response process for that case.

Different participants' accounts provide only partial and inconsistent perspective on the events in question.

Questions to consider when shaping the conditions of observation in Natural History studies:

* How can we be prepared to observe? (doing homework about how the domain works)
* What is the role of concepts and patterns in being prepared to be surprised?
* Who observes?
* What is the role of guides, informants, and others who mediate access to the field of activity?
* From where do we observe (what is the vantage point)? (e.g., points of naturally occurring disruption and change)


Coming to think, in part, like a *native*, is required, including understanding distinctions they make.

Must:
* describe a culture from the insider's perspective without getting lost in the natives' view.
* be authentically connected to practice 
* be able to setp out of flow of activity to reflect on the heart of practice


Requires means for coping with gap between what people do and what people say they do.

People:
* may not have access to the critical factors that influence their behavior
* never fail to have some model of:
    - how they work
    - the people, devices, and processes tehy interact with

No such thing as a cognitive vacuum for people as meaning-seeking agents.


#### Staged world

Investigators stage situations of interest through simulations of some type.

Concrete situation staged is an instantiation of the generic situation of interest.

Problem of the effective stimulus: mapping between target situation to be understood and test situation where observations are made must be explicit.

Fundamental attribute of staged world studies: invsetigators' ability to design the scenarios that participants face.

Allows for repeated observations.

Investigators introduce disturbances or probes that instantiate general demands in domain-specific and scenario-specific forms.

Researchers observe how JCS responds to the challenges embodied by the probe in context.

The capability critical for moving to Staged World studies is this ability to *design problems* and then express these probolems in specific scenarios.

A central skil in CSE is this ability to design problems and instantiate them in scenarios meaningful to actual practitioners.

Scenarios are a tentative model of practice: what is the nvelope of textbook situations, what complicating factors challenge this envelope, what demands and constraints drive practice.

In designing the situation, probes, and context, the goal is to uncover or make tangible, and, therefore, observable, what has been encoded in practice.

Once the problem structure is defined relative to domain-specific characteristics, can then *trace the process** of how the JCS responds to the challenges embedded through the probe events in context.

Example: How does the presence of an initail distrubance that masks key cues to the main fault affect the diagnostic search process.

#### Process tracing

1. Start with concrete case
2. Shift analysis from concrete case to abstract story: describe how practitioners handled the demands of the problem designed into the staged situation.
3. Contrast different performance descriptions

**Concrete case***

Analyze the process for handling situation in specific context.

**From concrete case to abstract story***

Identify general patterns or demands about JCSs. 

General patterns or demands about JCSs that were instantiated in the concrete
case are used to shift the analysis away from language of domain and specific
scenario, and into abstract story in terms of concepts being studied.

Analysis then shifts to develop a description of how practitionres handled the deamnds of the problem designed into the situation staged.


Re-tell each episode in terms of general conceptual patterns. Examples:
 * how over-simplifications led to erroneous actions
 * how participants avoided erroneous actions
 * how detecting deception is dificult
 * how people cope with the brittleness of the expert machine advisory system when complicated factors arise
 
 
 Concepts provide set of story archetypes used to provide more genderal description of behavior of practitioners relative to problems. Examples from the over-simplification pattern:

* observing how situations created opportunities for people to be trapped in over-simplifying ocmplex processes
* understanding what helps or hinders people when they need to shift from simpler to more complete models of complex processes in order to handle anomalies.

**Contrast different performance descriptions with contrast cases**

* different but related probes
* different scenarios
* different domains
* different artifacts

Helps researcher:
* abstract patterns
* build possible functional accounts of what is competent performance in the face of demands
* how performance is vulnerable to breakdown



Checklist for designing staged world field studies

1. What are the joint cognitive system issues in question?
2. Explicitly map target and test situation relationship.
3. Shape the test situation to address the general JCS issues.
4. Map canonical behavior; how does one prepare to be surprised?
5. Collect the data (update 4 as needed)
6. Collate multiple raw data sources to construct base protocol
7. Use concepts from 1 to build formal protocol
8. Cross-protocol contrasts
9. Integrate with other converging studies to build a functional model


Problematic items:

1. Pitfalls: superficial labels
2. Problem design, stimulus sampling. Pitfalls: psychologists fallacy, cover stories
3. Scenario design. Artifacts as tool for discovery. Procedure to externalize what underlies adapted activities.
4. (blank)
5. (blank)
6. Analyze each participant/team's process. Pitfalls: get lost in the raw data.
7. Pitfalls: get lost in the langauge of the domain; excessive micro-encodings; hindsight bias
8. Aggregate across teams and problems. Role of cognitive simulation, neutral observers
9. (blank)



(Figure 6 not captured here: Levels of analysis in process tracing studies)


Basic heuristic for functional synthesis: interplay of moving up and down levels of abstraction
* moving up abstracts particulars into patterns
* moving down puts abstract concepts into empirical jeopardy


Useful processes to observe:
* absorbing new artifacts into practice.
* how changes in the distributed system (e.g., new communication channel) affect coordination demands & capabilities

Goal of probing with new artifacts is as a tool for discovery, not artifact evaluation
* observe basic demands of practice by breaking through the fluency of current adaptations

The artifact functions as a hypothesis of what would prove useful.

Staged World studies are observational and discovery oriented: letting hte world tell su how it works.

The most basic role of the scientist is that of trained observer—one who sees with a fresh view,
wh wonders, child-like—*why is it this way, how does ito work?*—making fresh connections and generating new insights.


Studies must meet basic criteria:

* Means to establish warrant - how do you know?
* Standards of quality - how do you discern a competent investigation?
* Means to facilitate gneralizability - what is this a case of?


All require mapping between target situation to be understood and the test situation where observations are made.

#### Converging operations

DIfferent studies become part of a larger series of converging operations that overcome limits
of individual studies.

examine the same theme across different natural labs.

Studying work in contxt is a bootstrapping process that uses a set of converging operations.

Each technique provides tentative knowledge that expands ability to use another technique to wedge open how JCS functions.

Examples: 
* Richard Cook's studies of infusion devices in health care.
* Nadine Sarter's work on human-centered automation studying pilots on flight deck

* increase observability of what the automation will do next
* expand the directability of the automated systems as resources ro achieve operational goals
* tacticle cues to solve the problem of mode awareness

#### The psychologist's fallacy

This fallacy occurs when well-intentioned ovservers think that their distant
view of the workplace captures the acutal experience of those who perform work
in context.

The search for authenticity reveals a trade-off: the stronger the shaping of
the conditions of observation, the greater the disruption of the thing observed
and the greater the risk of Psychologist's Fallacy and its analogs.


## 6. Functional syntheses, laws and design

Functional syntheses → laws → meeting design challenges

### Properties of functional syntheses

* empirical: based on observations collected in different ways
* theoretical: proposes a model of how something functions in order to achieve goals

Characteristics of functional syntheses at work:

1. context bound, but generic
2. tentative: can be overturned/reinterpreted. Generates candidate explanations that attempt to meet sufficiency criteria: ability to carry out functions in question
3. goal oriented: functions of pieces change with purpose
4. provide accounts of how multiple goals & potential conflicts across goals present tradeoffs & dilemmas
5. concern dynamic processes so that change is fundamental
6. inherently multi-level
7. involve mutual interaction & adaptation of agent & environment (ecological)
8. support projections of how systems will respond when changes are introduced so that side effects of change can be identified without waiting for consequences to occur
9. reveal vulnerabilities for under- versus over-adpatation
10. capture what behavior is adapted to (variations & constraints) & how it is adapted to handle tehse constraints. This supports considering how to expand the adaptive power of the system. They have an ability to generate guides for constructive change
