## Laws

### Law of stretched systems 

Every system is stretched to operate at its capacity; as soon as there is some immprovement, for example, int eh form of new technology, it will be exploited to achieve a new intensity and tempo of activity.

p18


### Law of demands


What makes work difficult, to a first approximation, is likely to make work hard for any JCS regardless of the composition of human and/or machine agents.

p19

### Law of fluency

"Well"-adapted work occurs with a facility that belies the difficulty of the demands resolved and the dilemmas balanced.

## 1. Core activities and values

### Introduction

Four guiding values-authenticity, abstraction, discovery, participation-infuse the activities of Cognitive
Systems Engineering. WHen thes values are put into practice CSE discovers patterns in joint cognitive systems
(JCSs) at work, abstracts patterns in how joint cognitive systems work, and, ultimately, designs joint cognitive systems that work.

### Adaptability vs limits

The core ideas of CSE shift the question from overcoming limits to supporting adaptability and control.

The base unit of analysis is the JCS.

The key process to study, model and support is how people cope with complexity.

### Complementarity

Artifacts are not just objects; they are hypotheses about the interplay of people, technology and work.

### Core values of CSE in practice

* Observing work in context
* Abstracting patterns across specific settings and situations
* Innovating new concepts as hypotheses about what would be useful
* Participate in the struggle of envisioning with other stakeholders to create the future of work

CSE is concerned with how to transcend limits to authenticity in order to
capture how the strategies and behavior of people are adapted to the constraints
and demands of field of practice.

CSE confronts the *challenge of abstraction* to find and explain patterns behind the surface variability.

CSE is successful to the degree that it *sparks inventiveness* to discover new
ways of using technological possibilities to enhance work, to identify leverage
points, to seed development with promising directions, and to minimize negative
side effects of change.

CSE helps *create future possibilites* as participants with other stakeholders in that field of practice.

We are trying to understand how artifacts shape cognition and collaboration
given the organizational context and problem demands in fields of practice, and
how practtionres, individually and as groups, informally and formally, shape
artifacts to meet the demands fo fields of activity within the pressures and
resources provided by laarger organizations.

Practitioners adapt to work around difficulties and complexities, re-shaping
artifacts to function as tools to meet the demands of the field of activity.

### On systems in CSE

Systems perspective

* Interactions and emergence: relationships and interactions  across the parts
* Cross-scale interactions: multiple levels of analysis
* Perspective: parts of system and level of analysis are matter of perspective & purpose

Characteristics of artifacts and tasks interact to place demands on activities of and coordination across agents.

Characteristics of taks and needs for coordination across agents interact to specify how artifacts support work.

Properties of artifacts and agents interact to generate how strategies are adapted for work in the task domain.

Patterns in the intersections of people, technology & work:

* coordinated activity
* resilience
* affordance

users will develop many diverse models of the process or device and these models will be quite wrong.

### Patterns

### Summary

CSE is a systems approach to phenomena that emerge at the intersection of
people, technology and work. CSE draws on observations of JCSs at work; previous
general patterns are brought to these obesrvations; contact with work leads to
tentative abstractions about what patterns are present; this understanding
stimulates and guides the search for what would be useful to support the kinds
of work seen; these insights stimulate innovation fo design seeds in
participation with otehrs to support the work and processes of change.

CSE as a practice-centered research and design process, is generic but relevant.
It finds in the particular the existence and expression of universal patterns.
It tests and revises these patterns by seeing design concepts as tentative
hypotheses subjet to empirical jeopardy. These basic activities and values are
not contradictions or conflicts, but creative tensions at the root of
complementarity, harnessed for innovation.s


## Discovering patterns in joint cognitive systems at work

### Introduction

The study of joint cognitive systems in context is a process of discovering how
the behavior and strategies of practitioners are adapted ot the various purposes
and constraints of the field of activity. To study joint cognitive systems
requires going behind the more or less visible activities of practitioners to
uncover how these activities are parts of larger processes of collaboration and
coordination. The key is to uncover how people adapt to exploit capabilities and
workaround complexities as they pursue their goals.

### A JCS at work

Nuclear power control room training simulator. Observers discovered the operators acted
on unexpected changes in sound (system clicked when control rod system was active).

## 2. Joint cognitive systems adapt to cope with complexity


### Introduction

General patterns in cognitive work do not exist separate from particular
intersections of specific people, technologies and work activities. Hence, field
settings are more than unique domains or exotic fields of practice, but function
in parallel as natural laboratories where these generic patterns emerge. What
approaches would help us discover the essential patterns underlying the surface
diversity of people, technology and work? What techniques would help us begin to
unpack or partially ddcopose the complexities of systems of people, technologies
and work activities into meaningful parts and their interactions? How do we use
general patterns to guide cahnge and innovate new possibilities in concert with
other stakeholders? This chapter introduces the basics of how to shape the
conditions of observation, the consequences of the Law of Fluency, and the
central role of the Law of Deamdns in studying JCSs.

### Adaptation in joint cognitive systems at work

When new tech is introduced to field of practice, patterns of reverberations include:

* new capabiliteis, which incrase deamnds and crate enw complexities such as increased coupling across parts of the system and higher tempo of operations
* new complexities when technological possibilities are used clumsily
* adaptations by practitioners to exploit capabilities or workaround complexities because they are rspponsible to meet operational goals
* complexities and adaptations that are surprising, unintended side effects of the design intent
* failures that occasionally break through these adaptations because of the inherent demands or because the adaptations are incomplete, poor, or brittle
* adaptations by practitioners that hide the complexities from designers and from after-the-fact reviewers who judge failures to be due to human error

Law of stretched systems

Law of demands

Law of fluency

### Summary: adaptations directed to cope with complexity

Studying and modeling a JCS at work requires understanding how the system adapts and to what it is adapted. The three guiding genralizations are the Law of Stretched Systems, the Law of Fluency, and the Law of Demands.
