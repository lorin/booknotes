# Joint Cognitive Systems: Patterns in Cognitive Systems Engineering

Book by David D. Woods & Erik Hollnagel

A practical book.

are likely to adapt to the changes they introduce.

## 1. Core activities and values

### Adaptability vs limits

The core ideas of CSE shift the question from overcoming limits to supporting adaptability and control.

The base unit of analysis is the JCS.

The key process to study, model and support is how people cope with complexity.

### Complementarity

Artifacts are not just objects; they are hypotheses about the interplay of people, technology and work.

### Core values of CSE in practice

* Observing work in context
* Abstracting patterns across specific settings and situations
* Innovating new concepts as hypotheses about what would be useful
* Participate in the struggle of envisioning with other stakeholders to create the future of work

CSE is concerned with how to transcend limits to authenticity in order to
capture how the strategies and behavior of people are adapted to the constraints
and demands of field of practice.

CSE confronts the *challenge of abstraction* to find and explain patterns behind the surface variability.

CSE is successful to the degree that it *sparks inventiveness* to discover new
ways of using technological possibilities to enhance work, to identify leverage
points, to seed development with promising directions, and to minimize negative
side effects of change.

CSE helps *create future possibilites* as participants with other stakeholders in that field of practice.
* 
We are trying to understand how artifacts shape cognition and collaboration
given the organizational context and problem demands in fields of practice, and
how practtionres, individually and as groups, informally and formally, shape
artifacts to meet the demands fo fields of activity within the pressures and
resources provided by laarger organizations.

Practitioners adapt to work around difficulties and complexities, re-shaping
artifacts to function as tools to meet the demands of the field of activity.

### On systems in CSE

Systems perspective

* Interactions and emergence: relationships and interactions  across the parts
* Cross-scale interactions: multiple levels of analysis
* Perspective: parts of system and level of analysis are matter of perspective & purpose

Characteristics of artifacts and tasks interact to place demands on activities of and coordination across agents.

Characteristics of taks and needs for coordination across agents interact to specify how artifacts support work.

Properties of artifacts and agents interact to generate how strategies are adapted for work in the task domain.

Patterns in the intersections of people, technology & work:

* coordinated activity
* resilience
* affordance
