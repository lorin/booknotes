# Joint Cognitive Systems: Patterns in Cognitive Systems Engineering

Book by David D. Woods & Erik Hollnagel

A practical book.

This book is about how to inform the design of artifacts by taking into account how people
are likely to adapt to the changes they introduce.

Terms: joint cognitive systems, affordances, bumpable, artifact, work, pattern, interpredictability, adapt, complexity,
functional synthesis, bumpless transfer of control, automation surprise, clumsy automation, anomaly response,
demands, dilemmas, coordination, resilience
