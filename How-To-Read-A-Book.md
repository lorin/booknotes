Book by Mortimer J. Adler & Charles Van Doren

A practical book.

Terms: habit, structural, history, philosophy, science, practical, theoretical

General notes:

- If you can't rephrase the important sentences in your own words, you likely
  don't understand them.

## Levels of reading

1. Elementary
2. Inspectional reading (systematic skimming & superficial reading)
3. Analytical reading
4. Syntopical reading

## Inspectional reading I: systematic skimming or pre-reading

p32-35

1. Look at the title page and, if the book has one, its preface.
2. Study the table of contents to get a sense of the book's structure.
3. Check the index to estimate the range of topics and crucial terms.
4. Read the publisher's blurb.
5. Look at the chapters that seem to be pivotal to its arguments. Look at
   summary statements in opening and closing pages.
6. Turn the pages, dipping in here and there, reading a paragraph or two,
   sometimes several pages in sequence, never more than that. Read the last 2-3
   pages to get summary info.

## Inspectional reading I: superficial reading

Read straight through without stopping to ponder things you don't understand
right away.

## Basic questions to answer about a book

pp 46-47, 164-165

1. What is this book about, as a whole?
2. What is being said in detail, and how?
3. Is the book true, in whole or part?
4. What of it?


## Rules of analytical reading

### I. Finding what a book is about

1. You must know what kind of book you are reading, and you should know this as
   early in the process as possible, preferably before you begin to read. (p60) 
   Classify the book according to kind and subject matter (p95, 163).
2. State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most a few
   sentences (a short paragraph). (p75)
   State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity (p95, p163).
3. Set forth the major parts of the book, and show how these are organized into
   a whole, by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole.
   (p76)
   Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these
   parts as you have outlined the whole (p95, p163).
4. Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve. (p92, p95, p163)

### II. Interpreting a book's contents

5. Find the important words and come to terms. (p98)
   Come to terms with the author by interperting his key words. (p136, p163)
6. Mark the most important sentences in a book and discover the propositions
   they contain. (p120)
   Grasp the author's leading propositions by dealing with his most important
   sentences. (p136,p163)
7. Locate or construct the basic arguments in the book by finding them in the
   connection of sentences. (p120) *Alternatively*: Find if you can the paragraphs in a book
   that state its important arguments; but if the arguments are not thus
   expressed, your task is to construct them, by taking a sentence from this
   paragraph, and one from that, until you have gathered together the sequence
   of sentences that state the propositions that compose the argument.
   (pp 129-130).
   Know the author's arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out
   of, sequences of sentences (p?, p163).
8. Find out what the author's solutions are. (p135)
   Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not;
   and as the latter decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.
   (p135, p163)

### III. Criticitizing a book as a communication of knowledge

#### A. General maxims of intellectual etiquette

9. You must be able to say, with reasonable certainty, "I understand," before
   you can say any one of the following things: "I agree," or "I disagree," or "I
   suspend judgment" (pp142-143).
10. When you disagree, do so reasonably, and not disputatiously or
    contentiously. (p145)
11. Respect the difference between knowledge and more personal opinion, by
    giving reasons for any critical judgment you have. (p150)

#### B. Special criteria for poitns of criticism

12. Show wherein the author is uninformed.
13. Show wherein the author is misinformed.
14. Show wherein the author is illogical.
15. Show wherein the author's analysis or account is incomplete.

Rules summarized on p95, p120, p135, pp164-165.

## Disagreeing

p156

1. Authors is uninformed
2. Author is misinformed
3. Author is illogical -- reasoning is not cogent
4. Analysis is incomplete
