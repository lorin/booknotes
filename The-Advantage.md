Sophistication bias: Org health is so simple & accessible that many leaders have
a hard time seeting it as a real oppportunity for meaningful advantage.

Adrenaline bias: Becoming a healthy org takes a little time, and many leaders are addicted
to adrenaline rush.

Quantification bias: Benefits of becoming a healthy org are difficult to accurately quantify

Smart: good at classic fundamentals of business

Healthy: minimal politics & confusion, high degrees of morale & productivity, very low turnover among good employees

Permission to play: minimum standard required for having even a possibility of success

Leadership team: a small group of people who are collectively responsible for achieving a common objective for their org

Vulnerability-based trust: when members get to a point where they are completely
comfortable being transparent, honest, and naked with one another, where they
say and genuinely mean things like "I screwed up", "I need help," "Your idea is
better than mine," "I wish I could learn to do that as well as you do", and
even, "I'm sorry."

Real-time permission: leader interrupts when people engage in disagreement
during a meeting, to remind them what they are doing is good

Values stampede: overly broad values statement, due to trying to be all things to all people

Strategic anchors: provide context for all decision making and help companies
avoid temptation to make purely pragmatic and opportunistic decisions that so
often end up diminishing company's plan for success

Strategy amoeba: big amoeba-like shape drawn on a flip chart that is filled in with terms and phrases

Strategic durability: how often org needs to change its strategic anchors. Function of rate of innovation and barriers to entry

Thematic goal: The rallying cry. Answers the question *What is most important, right now?*. It is:
  * singular
  * qualitative
  * temporary
  * shared across the leadership team
  
Examples of a thematic goal:
* make the new airline partnership work
* rebuild credibility with the business
* expand our consulting practice
  
Standard operating objectives: ongoing and relatively straightforward metrics
and areas of responsibility that any leadership team must maintain in order to
keep the org afloat.

One-page model: single sheet of paper should contain
* thematic goals
* defining objectives
* standard objectives

Playbook: simple document summarizing answers to the six critical questions
* short (a few pages)
* leadership team members should keep playbook with them at all times

Non-generics: prefer shorter customized performance review form over a longer generic one

## Checklist for organizational health

### Discipline 1: build a cohesive leadership team

* [ ] The leaderhip team is small enough (3-10 people) to be effective.
* [ ] Members of the team trust one another and can be genuinely vulnerable with each other.
* [ ] Team members regularly engage in productive, unfiltered conflict around important issues.
* [ ] The team leaves meetings with clear-cut, active, and specific agreements around decisions.
* [ ] Team members hold one another accountable to commitments and behaviors.
* [ ] Members of the leadership team are focused on team number one. They put the
  collective priorities and needs of the larger organization ahead of their own
  departments.


### Discipline 2: create clarity

* [ ] Members of the leadership team know, agree on, and are passionate about the reason that the org exists.
* [ ] The leadership team has clarified and embraced a small, specific set of behavioral values.
* [ ] Leaders are clear and algined around a strategy that helps them define success and differentiate from competitors.
* [ ] The leadership team has a clear, current goal around which they rally. They feel a collective sense of ownershpi for that goal.
* [ ] Members of the leadership team understand one another's roles and
  responsibilities. They are comfortable asking questions about one another's
  work.
* [ ] The elements of the orgs' clarity are concisely summarized and regularly referenced and reviewed by the leadership team.


### Discipline 3: Overcommunicate clarity

* [ ] The leadership team has clearly communicated the six aspects of clarity to all employees.
* [ ] Team members regularly remind the people in their departments about those aspects of clarity.
* [ ] The team leaves meetings with clear and specific agreements about what to
  communicate to their employees, and they cascade those messages quickly after
  meetings.
* [ ] Employees are able to accurately articulate the orgs' reason for existence, values, strategic anchors, and goals.


### Discipline 4: Reinforce clarity

* [ ] The organization has a simple way to ensure that new hires are carefully selected based on the company's values.
* [ ] New people are brought into the org by thoroughly teaching them about the six elements of clarity.
* [ ] Mangers throughout the org have a simple, consistent and nonbueaucratic system
  for setting goals and reviewing progress with employees. That system is
  customized around the elements of clarity.
* [ ] Employees who don't fit the values are managed out of the org. Poor performers
  who do fit the values are given the coaching and assistance they need to
  succeed.
* [ ] Compensation and reward systemes are built around the values and goals of the org.

### Meetings

* [ ] Tactical and strategic discussions are addressed in separate meetings.
* [ ] During tactical staff meetings, agends are set only after the tem has reviewed
  its progress against goals. Noncritical administrative topics are easily
  discarded.
* [ ] During topical meetings, enough time is allocated to major issues to allow for
  clarification, debate, and resolution.
* [ ] The team meets quarterly away from the office to review what is happening in the industry, in the org, and on the team.
