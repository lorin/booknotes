## Checklist for organizational health

### Discipline 1: build a cohesive leadership team

* The leaderhip team is small enough (3-10 people) to be effective.
* Members of the team trust one another and can be genuinely vulnerable with each other.
* Team members regularly engage in productive, unfiltered conflict around important issues.
* The team leaves meetings with clear-cut, active, and specific agreements around decisions.
* Team members hold one another accountable to commitments and behaviors.
* Members of the leadership team are focused on team number one. They put the
  collective priorities and needs of the larger organization ahead of their own
  departments.


### Discipline 2: create clarity

* Members of the leadership team know, agree on, and are passionate about the reason that the org exists.
* The leadership team has clarified and embraced a small, specific set of behavioral values.
* Leaders are clear and algined around a strategy that helps them define success and differentiate from competitors.
* The leadership team has a clear, current goal around which they rally. They feel a collective sense of ownershpi for that goal.
* Members of the leadership team understand one another's roles and
  responsibilities. They are comfortable asking questions about one another's
  work.
* The elements of the orgs' clarity are concisely summarized and regularly referenced and reviewed by the leadership team.


### Discipline 3: Overcommunicate clarity

* The leadership team has clearly communicated the six aspects of clarity to all employees.
* Team members regularly remind the people in their departments about those aspects of clarity.
* The team leaves meetings with clear and specific agreements about what to
  communicate to their employees, and they cascade those messages quickly after
  meetings.
* Employees are able to accurately articulate the orgs' reason for existence, values, strategic anchors, and goals.


### Discipline 4: Reinforce clarity

* The organization has a simple way to ensure that new hires are carefully selected based on the company's values.
* New people are brought into the org by thoroughly teaching them about the six elements of clarity.
* Mangers throughout the org have a simple, consistent and nonbueaucratic system
  for setting goals and reviewing progress with employees. That system is
  customized around the elements of clarity.
* Employees who don't fit the values are managed out of the org. Poor performers
  who do fit the values are given the coaching and assistance they need to
  succeed.
* Compensation and reward systemes are built around the values and goals of the org.

### Meetings

* Tactical and strategic discussions are addressed in separate meetings.
* During tactical staff meetings, agends are set only after the tem has reviewed
  its progress against goals. Noncritical administrative topics are easily
  discarded.
* During topical meetings, enough time is allocated to major issues to allow for
  clarification, debate, and resolution.
* The team meets quarterly away from the office to review what is happening in the industry, in the org, and on the team.
