## Abstract

Jens Rasmussen has been a very influential thinker for the last quarter of the
20th century in the safety science field and especially in major hazard
prevention. He shaped many of the basic assumptions regarding safety and
accidents which are still held today. One can see that many of his ideas
underlie more recent advances in this field. Indeed, in the first decade of the
21st century, many have been inspired by his propositions and have pursued
their own research agendas by using, extending or criticising his ideas. The
author of numerous articles, chapters of books and books, Rasmussen had an
inspiring scientific research record spreading over 30 years, expanding across
the boundaries of many scientific disciplines. This article introduces selected
elements of Rasmussen’s legacy, including the SRK model, his theoretical
approach of errors, the issue of investigating accidents, his model of
migration and the sociotechnical view. It will be demonstrated that Jens
Rasmussen provided key concepts for understanding safety and accidents, many of
which are still relevant today. In particular, this article introduces how some
principles such as degree of freedom, self organisation and adaptation, defence
in depth fallacy but also the notion of error as ‘unsuccessful experiment with
unacceptable consequences’ still offer powerful insights into the challenge of
predicting and preventing major accidents. It is also argued that they combine
into a specific interpretation of the ‘normal accident’ debate, anticipating
current trends based on complexity lenses. Overall, Jens Rasmussen defines the
contours of what is called ‘a strong program for a hard problem’.

## Outline

1. Introduction
	* Two articles on Jens Rasmussen's legacy
	* Preliminary remarks
2. Methodology
	* Article sections
3. Modelling process plant operator in relation to engineering issues
	* Genesis of the model
	* Hollnagel's critique of SRK
4. The conceputalisation of 'human error'
	* Two independent fields, 'psychology' and 'cognitive engineering'
	* An early 'naturalistic' perspective on 'human error'
5. The difference between technical and human reliability/safety analysis
6. Intermediate comments
7. A new vision for accident and safety
	* Degree of freedom, self-organnisation and defence-in-depth fallacy
	* A 'normal accident' perspective, as the product of organi
## Notes

* Emphasized importance of studying real life situations instead of experimental data
* Importance of context in shaping cognitive strategies
* quote: *to optimize performance, to develop smooth and efficient skills, it
  is very important to have opportunities to perform trial and error  experiments, and humans 
  errors can in a way be considered as unsuccessful experiments with unacceptable consequences*
* Rasmussen was critical of human reliability assessment (HRA)
* fallacy of defence-in-depth: *one basic problem is that in such a system
  having functionally redundant protective defenses, a local violation of one of
  the defenses has no immediate, visible effect and then may not be observed in
  action. In this situation the boundary of safe behaviour of one particular
  actor depends on the possible violation of defenses by other actors.*

### Skill-rule-knowledge (SKR) model

* Three levels model
* 1. Skill-based behaviour
	- automatic or unconscious processes 
	- internalised through experience
	- triggered by sensory inputs
* 2. Rule-based behaviour
	- Explicit, known rules
	- Operators consciously active to perform specific tasks
* 3. Knowledge-based behaviour
	- Ability in new circumstances to find responses that are:
	- not directly available in the operator's repertoire
	- require considerable attention and concentration

### Difference in approach Reason & Mycielska
1. Reason and Micielska consider error from a psychological angle
2. Reason and Micielska focused on types of errors related to automatic or
   unconscious cognitive processes that could be categorised as 'slips' or
   'lapses'.
3. The absence of detailed empirical study of real-life situations of operators of
   technological systems in the theoretical approach of Reason and Micielska


## Fallacy of defense in depth

From <http://www.macroresilience.com/2011/12/29/people-make-poor-monitors-for-computers/> quoting James Reason:

> the system very often does not respond actively to single faults. Consequently, many errors and faults made by the staff and maintenance personnel do not directly reveal themselves by functional response from the system. Humans can operate with an extremely high level of reliability in a dynamic environment when slips and mistakes have immediately visible effects and can be corrected……Violation of safety preconditions during work on the system will probably not result in an immediate functional response, and latent effects of erroneous acts can therefore be left in the system. When such errors are allowed to be present in a system over a longer period of time, the probability of coincidence of the multiple faults necessary for release of an accident is drastically increased. Analyses of major accidents typically show that the basic safety of the system has eroded due to latent errors.
