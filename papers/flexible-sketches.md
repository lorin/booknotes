The author did a participant observation study of a mid-sized engineering company that builds large engines for industrial applications. Studied their transition to CAD/CAM software.


## Abstract

Engineering sketches and drawings are the building blocks of technological design and production. These visual representations act as the means for organizing the design to production process, hence serving as a "social glue" both between individuals and between groups. The author discusses two main capacities such visual representations serve in facilitating distributed cognition in team design work As conscription devices, they enlist and organize group participation. As boundary objects, they facilitate the reading of alternative meanings by various groups involved in the design process. The introduction of computer-aided design into this visual culture of engineering restructures relationships between workers in ways that can hamper the flexibility necessary for these crucial capacities to take place. The data are drawn from a study of the daily practices of engineers engaged in redesigning a turbine engine package. The method is participant observation.

## Words I underlined


### p1

A professional model maker, unable verbally to describe what he is working on, walks across the room to fetch a drawing so he can point to its various parts.

"I can't think without my drawing board"

### p2

Coordination and conflict take place over, on, and through the drawings.

visual representations shape the structure of the work

Contrary to the still-persistent mythology of the so-called scientific age
that has long attributed technological accomplishments to the virtue of
"scientific truth" addressed to human needs, it is the mundane interactions
of actors, machines, and paper that construct technological innovation.


The drawings and sketches themselves structure the work process as well as its product.

this study looks at the role of visual presentaitons in present-day engineering practices.


The destruction of important situated practices within the visual conventions  of design activity lies in an elementary midunderstanding of both the practices themselves and their interactive character.

These fundamental misunderstandings are cosntructed into the CAD/CAM system, whose designers assume a linear theory of innovation that projects a straightforward process from idea, to drawing, to prototype, to production.


### p3 

A boundary object allows members of different groups to read different meanings particcular to their needs from the same material.
