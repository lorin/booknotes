# Phrases

* conditions for operation are underspecified
* systems are human systems
* challenges to adaptation
* how systems adpt their plans in progress
* operators fill the gaps
* not capable of adpating and acting fast enough
* how hard the agents under supervision are working
* network of interdepnendencies
* avoid working at cross purposes
* progress at one echelon of the system introduces higher demands at another echelon
* successful in the past
* no longer met
* lack of capcaity to revise plans in progress
* running out of capacity
* rapidly mobilize large amounts of resources
* coordination broke down
* distributed and interdpenednent units
* delegation of authority
* right level of delegation
* communicate their intent
* the selection of what to look at 
* what to learn from 
* it is a limitation to consider that events that have produced the worse outcomes are also the ones that will produce the most useful lessons.
* Instances where challenging and surprising situations are managed without leading to severe outcomes, often reveal interesting and innovative forms of adaptations.
* The difficulty is for organizations to transform such learning opportunities that occur at a local level into knowledge generated at a global scale, including into modifications or revisions of practices that have proved successful in various contexts.
* resilience engineering holds the belief that sociotechnical systems are not trapped in complexity
* reflect on their actions
* managing their adaptive capacity
* th ebelief that suprrising events will occur
* deploy new ways of functionality
* the resilience of a system corresponds to its adaptive capacity tuned to the future
* existence of a trade-off between increasing optimal performance and increasing the capacity to handle unanticipated distrubances.
* focusing solely on a system's optimal performance may have a negative impact on its resilience
* How much is the system in contorl?
* manage shared resourcse
* Amplifying control then consists of developing tools that help reveal/track relevant interdependencies and help anticipate how projected actions will propagate (resonate) across interdpendencies relative to goals.



## Sections

* Introduction
* Basic patterns of how adaptive systems fail
    1. Decompensation: exxhausting capacity to adapt as distirubances/challengs cascade
    2. Working at cross-puproses: behavior that is locally adaptive but globally maladaptive
    3. Getting stuck in outdated behaviors: the world changes but the system remains stuck in what wer previously adpative strategies
* Successes and failures to address the patterns in real work situations
    - Coping with increasing sdemands
    - Working in a network of interdpendencies
    - Detecting the need to adapt on-going strategies
* Towards intelligent adaptive systems
    - Resilience and the management of adaptive capacity
    - The need for polycentric control
    - Supporting polycentric control
* Conclusion
