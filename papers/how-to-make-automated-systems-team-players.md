## Outline

* Human-automation cooperation: what have we learned
    - Escaping from attributions of human error versus over-automation
    - The substitution myth
    - How to design for coordination: observability and direactability
* Observability: opening up the black box
    - Data availability does not equal informativeness
* Directability: who owns the problem?
    - Whither automated agents? Invset in design for team play
* Summary

## Proposed new approaches to providing effective feedback


### Event-based

* highlight changes & events

### Future-oriented

* explicit support for anticipatory reasoning
* what should/will happen next?
* when will it happen?

### Pattern-based

* detect abnormalities / unexpected conditions at a glance
