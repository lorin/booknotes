### Self-awarenss (understanding self)

* Recognize and manage own behaviours within helping relationship
* Use empathy appropriately



## Ch 7. Setting up the mentoring programme

Ideally, just enough structure to ensure:

* mentors and mentees are reasonably well-matched
* they understand their roles and how the realtionship evolves
* they have enough relevant skills and tools resources to start with confidence
* the progress of each relationship is monitored so programme manager can
  intervene, if needed
* participants feel there is alignment between org's aims for programme and
  their own
* top management understands programme and can give appropriate support as
  needed


### Ensure acceptance of the time involved

* Meet between once a month and once a quarter
* Meetings should last 60-90 minutes


## Ch 8. Beginning the mentoring relationship

* Both should have clear idea of objectives of the relationship
* Objectives may be vague because one of the goals is to define objectives

Should start with:

* some form of assessment of mentee's strengths and weaknesses
* nature of transition he/she would like to make
* what longer-term ambitions are

Typical starting objectives:

* Help mentee developer greater self-insight and self-awareness - to become
  clearer about personal values and identity
* Introduce mentee to other, parallel functions or depts whose work he/she will
  need to understand to progress, or that may open eyes to potential sideways
  moves
* Help mentee develop and refine personal sense of purpose - what is it they
  want to contribute to the world?
* Help mentee break down seemingly impossible or far-fetched goal into series
  of more tangible tasks he/she can begin to address
* Help mentee think through how to raise visibility where it matters
* Help mentee establish informal networks needed to be effective in the org
* Act as sounding board in helping mentee work out how to manage difficult
  relationships with working colleagues
* Help mentee think through how to apply in practice what learning through
  theoretical study
* Gain a real understanding of career choices that face mentee and implications
  of each choice

Sometimes objectives are process-oreinted

* Meet mentee once a month for at least an hour
* Ensure mentee maintains brief diary of daily events to form basis for monthly
  discussion
* Develop personal relationship with mentee
* Maintain the relationship for two years

### Ethical code of practice for mentoring

* The mentor’s role is to respond to the mentee’s developmental needs and agenda; it is not to impose his or her own agenda.
* Mentors must work within the current agreement with the mentee about confidentiality that is appropriate within the context.
* The mentor will not intrude into areas the mentee wishes to keep private until invited to do so. However, he or she should help the mentee recognise how other issues may relate to those areas.
* Mentor and mentee should aim to be open and truthful with each other and themselves about the relationship itself.
* The mentoring relationship must not be exploitative in any way, nor can it be open to misinterpretation.
* Mentors need to be aware of the limits of their own competence and operate within these limits.
* Mentors have a responsibility to develop their own competence in the practice of mentoring.
* The mentee must accept increasing responsibility for managing the relationship; the mentor should empower them to do so and must generally promote the mentee’s autonomy.
* Mentor and mentee should respect each other’s time and other responsibilities, ensuring that they do not impose beyond what is reasonable.
* Mentor and mentee share responsibility for the smooth winding down of the relationship when it has achieved its purpose – they must both avoid creating dependency.
* Either party may dissolve the relationship. However, both mentor and mentee have a responsibility for discussing the matter together as part of mutual learning.
* The mentee should be aware of his or her rights and any complaints procedures.
* Mentors must be aware of any current law and work within the law.

### The first meeting

Aim: establish rapport and gain sense of relationship purpose

Both need to feel they can work with each other and learn from each other

Quality of rapport depends on perception that they share common values

Should start with some form of assessment of mentee's strengths and weaknesses
