# What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical
History

Book by Walter G. Vincenti


This book is a collection of case studies about how certain types of
engineering evolved in aeronautics, with some synthesis at the end of the book.


## General notes
- Engineering knowledge is distinct from scientific knowledge
- Three types of engineering work: design, construction, operation. (The book
    focuses on design and construction).

## Ch 1: Introduction: Engineering as Knowledge

Engineering knowledge is an autonomous body of knowledge, identifiabily different
from scientific knowlege (p3)

"Aeroplanes are not designed by science, but by art" (p4)

there is a big gap betwen scientific research and the engineering product which
has to be bridged by the art of the engineer (p4)

Vincenti quotes G.F.C. Rogers (with Vincenit's additions in brackets):

> Engineering refers to the practice of organizing the design and construction
> [and, I would add, operation] of any artifice which transform the physical
> world around us to meet some recognized need.


## Ch 2: Design and the Growth of Knowledge: The Davis Wing and the Problem of Airfoil Design, 1908—1945

## Ch 3: Establishment of Design Requirements: Flying-Quality Specifications for American Aircraft, 1918–1943

## Ch 4: A Theoretical Tool for Design:  Control-Volume Analyais, 1912–1953

Control-volume analysis is a mathematial technique for analysis. It's notable in
that it is used by engineers but not physicists.

## Ch 5: Data for Design: The Air-Propeller Tests of W.F. Durand and E.P.  Lesley, 1916–1926

## Ch 6. Design and Prdouction: The Innovation of Flush Riveting in American Airplanes, 1930–1950

## Ch. 7: The Anatomy of Engineering Design Knowledge

## Ch. 8: A Variation-Selection Model for the Growth of Engineering Knowledge
