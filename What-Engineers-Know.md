# What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical
History

Book by Walter G. Vincenti


This book describes five case studies about engineering work in aeronautics from
the first half of the twentieth century, with some synthesis at the end of the book.


## General notes
- Engineering knowledge is distinct from scientific knowledge
- Three types of engineering work: design, construction, operation. (The book
    focuses on design and construction).

Terms: design, normal design

## Ch 1: Introduction: Engineering as Knowledge

Engineering knowledge is an autonomous body of knowledge, identifiabily different
from scientific knowlege (p3)

"Aeroplanes are not designed by science, but by art" (p4)

there is a big gap betwen scientific research and the engineering product which
has to be bridged by the art of the engineer (p4)

Vincenti quotes G.F.C. Rogers (with Vincenit's additions in brackets):

> Engineering refers to the practice of organizing the design and construction
> [and, I would add, operation] of any artifice which transform the physical
> world around us to meet some recognized need.

Focus of the book is on *normal design*, as opposed to radical design.

Levels of design for airplanes:

1. Project definition
2. Overall design
3. Major-component design
4. Subdivision of areas of component design
5. Further subdivision into highly specific problems

- Problems at upper levels tends to be conceptual and relatively unstructural
- Most effort is at lower levels
- At lower levels, problems are usually well-defined and activity is highly
    structured


## Ch 2: Design and the Growth of Knowledge: The Davis Wing and the Problem of Airfoil Design, 1908—1945

## Ch 3: Establishment of Design Requirements: Flying-Quality Specifications for American Aircraft, 1918–1943

## Ch 4: A Theoretical Tool for Design:  Control-Volume Analyais, 1912–1953

Control-volume analysis is a mathematial technique for analysis. It's notable in
that it is used by engineers but not physicists.

## Ch 5: Data for Design: The Air-Propeller Tests of W.F. Durand and E.P.  Lesley, 1916–1926

## Ch 6. Design and Prdouction: The Innovation of Flush Riveting in American Airplanes, 1930–1950

## Ch. 7: The Anatomy of Engineering Design Knowledge

## Ch. 8: A Variation-Selection Model for the Growth of Engineering Knowledge
