# How to meaasure anything
Douglas W. Hubbard

*Measurement*: a set of observations that reduce uncertainty where the result is
expressed as a quantity.

Clarification chain:

1. If it matters at all, it is detectable/observable.
2. If it is detectable, it can be detecte as an amount (or range of possible amounts).
3. If it can be detected as a range of possible amounts, it can be measured.

 Four useful measurement assumptions:

1. Your problem is not as unique as you think.
2. You have more data than you think.
3. You need less data than you think.
4. There is a useful measurement that is much simpler than you think.

Universal approach questions:

1. What are you trying to measure? What is the real meaning of the alleged
   "intangible"?
2. Why do you care—what's the decision and where is the "threshold"?
3. How much do you know now—what ranges or probabilities represent your
   uncertainty about this?
4. What is the value of the information? What are the consequenecs of beign
   wrong and the chance of beign wrong, and what, if any, emasurement effort
   would be justified?
5. Within a cost justified by the information value, which observations would
   confirm or eliminate different possibilities? For each possible scenario,
   what is the simplest thing we should see if that scenario were true?
6. How do you conduct the measurement that accounts for various types of
   avoidable errors (again, where the cost is less than the value of the
   information)?


Before we measure, ask (p43):

1. What is the decision this is supposed to support?
2. What really is the thing being measured?
3. Why does this thing matter to the decision being asked?
4. What do you kwno about it now?
5. What is the value to measuring it further?
