## Passion is bullshit

* best loan customer has no passion whatsoever, just a desire to work hard at
  something that looks good on a spreadsheet
* passionate people are more likely to take big risks in pursuit of unlikely
  goals, so you would expect to see more failures and more huge success among
  the passionate
* easy to be passionate about things that are working out, distorts impression
  of importance of passion
* success caused passion mor ethan passion caused success
* sometimes passion is simply a by-product of knowing you will be good at
  something

## Goals versus systems

*goal*: a specific objective that you either achieve or don't sometime in the
future (reach-it-and-be-done)

*system*: something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of
happiness in the long run 
* no deadline
* a reasonable person expects it to work more often than not


goal vs system:
* goal: waiting to achieve it someday in the future
* system: something you do every day


Examples of systems:
* continually look for better options
* Zuckerberg: studying hard, getting extraordinary grades, go to a top college,
  develop a skill set with tech that virtually guarantees riches in today's
  world
* Warren Buffett: buy undervalued companies and hold them forever

Why goals are bad:
* goal-oriented people exist in a state of nearly continuous failure that they
help will be temporary

Dieting:
* goal: lose 20 pounds
* system: eat right

Exercise:
* goal: run a marathon in under four hours
* system: exercise daily

## My system

Adams's System: create something the public wants and reproduce it in large quantitites
* didn't want to sell time: model has an upwaard limit
* wanted to create/invent/write or otherwise concoct something widely desired
  that would be easy to reproduce
* tried many different things until something creative struck a chord with the
  public
* nearly guarantees a string of failures
* all efforts are long shots
* because systems-oriented instead of goal-oriented, didn't give up
* *today's the day*

## Deciding versus wanting

* Advice: If you want success, figure out the price, then pay it
* When you decide to be successful in a big way, you acknowledge the price and
  you're willing to pay it
* Successful people don't wish for success, they decide to pursue it
* Success always has a price, but the reality is that the price is negotiable
* If you pick the right system, the price will be a lot nearer what you're
  willing to pay

## The selfishness illusion

Three kinds of people in the world:

1. Selfish
2. Stupid
3. Burden on others

Most important form of selfishness involves spending time on your fitness,
eating right, purusing your career, and still spending quality time with yoour
family and friends.

## THe energy metric

Humans want many things:
* good health
* financial freedom
* accomplishment
* a great social life
* love
* sex
* recreation
* travel
* family
* career
*  more

Focus on just one main metric: energy

Maximize personal energy because that makes it easier to manage all of the
other priorities.

Maximizing personal energy:
* eating right
* exercising
* getting enough sleep
* having something in my life that makes me excited to wake up

Main reason I blog is because it energizes me

This book is another example of something that gets my energy up.

personal energy: anything that gives you a positive lift, either mentally or
physically

For me, shopping is an energy killer.

Match your mental state to the task
- when Ifirst wake up, my brain si relaxed and creative
* By 2PM, all I can do is regurgitate ideas I've seen elsewhere
* When lunchtime rolls around, I like to grab a quick snack and go to the gym
  or play tennis
* In late afternoon and early evening, I'm relaxed from exercising and ready
  to do simple, mindless mechanical tasks (eg., draw final art for Dilbert,
  pay bills online)
* For first 16 years of corporate life, got up at 4AM to do creative side
  projects

### Simplifiers versus optimizers

* if situation involves communication with others, simplification is almost alays the right answer
* if task is something you can do all by yyourself, or with a partner on your
  wavelength, optimizing might be a better path if you can control most
  variables in the situation
* I prefer simplicity whenever I'm choosing a *system* to use
* simple systems are probably the best way to achieve success
* simplification frees up time

### Sitting position

* dedicate certain sitting positions and certain work spaces to work and other
  spaces to relaxation or play
* becomes a way to manipulate your energy levels and concentration

### Tidiness

* tidiness has an impact on your energy

### Knowledge and the lack thereof

* when you start asking questions, you often discover that:
    - there's a simple solution
    - there's a web site that handles it
    - there's a professional who takes care of it for a reasonable fee

* most of my problems were caused by my own bad decisions, lack of skill, and
  bad luck, not not being able to find information that I knew I needed

### Don't be an asshole


## Summary

* Focus on your diet first and get that right so you have energy to *want* to
  exercise
* Exercise will further improve your energy, which will make you more
  productive, creativie, positive, socially desirable, able to handle life's
  little bumps
* learn multiple skills to improve odds of success
* avoid jobs that require you to sell your limited supply of time while
  preparing you fro nothing better
* happiness is the only useful goal in life
* your own happiness will depend on being good to others
* happiness happens when: good health, resources, and a flexible schedule
* key skills:
    - public speaking
    - business writing
    - knowing psychology of persuasion
    - understanding of basic technology concepts
    - social skills
    - proper voice technique
    - good grammar
    - basic accounting
* develop a habit of simplifying
* learn how to make small talk with strangers
* learn how to avoid being an asshole
* think of yourself as a moist robot, not a skin big full of magic and mystery
    - if you control the inputs, you can determine the outputs
    - eat right
    - exercise
    - think positively
    - learn as much as possible
* look for patterns in every part of life (diet, exercise, components of
  success)
* try to find scientific backing for observed patterns
* use yourself as a lab to see if patterns hold for you
* goals are for losers, systems are for winners
* failure is your friend
    - raw material of success
    - invite it in
    - learn from it
    - don't let it leave until you pick its pocket
