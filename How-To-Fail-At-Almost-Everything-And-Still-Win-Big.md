## Passion is bullshit

* best loan customer has no passion whatsoever, just a desire to work hard at
  something that looks good on a spreadsheet
* passionate people are more likely to take big risks in pursuit of unlikely
  goals, so you would expect to see more failures and more huge success among
  the passionate
* easy to be passionate about things that are working out, distorts impression
  of importance of passion
* success caused passion mor ethan passion caused success
* sometimes passion is simply a by-product of knowing you will be good at
  something

## Goals versus systems

*goal*: a specific objective that you either achieve or don't sometime in the
future (reach-it-and-be-done)

*system*: something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of
happiness in the long run 
* no deadline
* a reasonable person expects it to work more often than not


goal vs system:
* goal: waiting to achieve it someday in the future
* system: something you do every day


Examples of systems:
* continually look for better options
* Zuckerberg: studying hard, getting extraordinary grades, go to a top college,
  develop a skill set with tech that virtually guarantees riches in today's
  world
* Warren Buffett: buy undervalued companies and hold them forever

Why goals are bad:
* goal-oriented people exist in a state of nearly continuous failure that they
help will be temporary

Dieting:
* goal: lose 20 pounds
* system: eat right

Exercise:
* goal: run a marathon in under four hours
* system: exercise daily

## My system

Adams's System: create something the public wants and reproduce it in large quantitites
* didn't want to sell time: model has an upwaard limit
* wanted to create/invent/write or otherwise concoct something widely desired
  that would be easy to reproduce
* tried many different things until something creative struck a chord with the
  public
* nearly guarantees a string of failures
* all efforts are long shots
* because systems-oriented instead of goal-oriented, didn't give up
* *today's the day*

## Deciding versus wanting

* Advice: If you want success, figure out the price, then pay it
* When you decide to be successful in a big way, you acknowledge the price and
  you're willing to pay it
* Successful people don't wish for success, they decide to pursue it
* Success always has a price, but the reality is that the price is negotiable
* If you pick the right system, the price will be a lot nearer what you're
  willing to pay

## The selfishness illusion

Three kinds of people in the world:

1. Selfish
2. Stupid
3. Burden on others

Most important form of selfishness involves spending time on your fitness,
eating right, purusing your career, and still spending quality time with yoour
family and friends.

## THe energy metric

Humans want many things:
* good health
* financial freedom
* accomplishment
* a great social life
* love
* sex
* recreation
* travel
* family
* career
*  more

Focus on just one main metric: energy

Maximize personal energy because that makes it easier to manage all of the
other priorities.

Maximizing personal energy:
* eating right
* exercising
* getting enough sleep
* having something in my life that makes me excited to wake up

Main reason I blog is because it energizes me

This book is another example of something that gets my energy up.

personal energy: anything that gives you a positive lift, either mentally or
physically

For me, shopping is an energy killer.

Match your mental state to the task
- when Ifirst wake up, my brain si relaxed and creative
* By 2PM, all I can do is regurgitate ideas I've seen elsewhere
* When lunchtime rolls around, I like to grab a quick snack and go to the gym
  or play tennis
* In late afternoon and early evening, I'm relaxed from exercising and ready
  to do simple, mindless mechanical tasks (eg., draw final art for Dilbert,
  pay bills online)
* For first 16 years of corporate life, got up at 4AM to do creative side
  projects

### Simplifiers versus optimizers

* if situation involves communication with others, simplification is almost alays the right answer
* if task is something you can do all by yyourself, or with a partner on your
  wavelength, optimizing might be a better path if you can control most
  variables in the situation
* I prefer simplicity whenever I'm choosing a *system* to use
* simple systems are probably the best way to achieve success
* simplification frees up time

### Sitting position

* dedicate certain sitting positions and certain work spaces to work and other
  spaces to relaxation or play
* becomes a way to manipulate your energy levels and concentration

### Tidiness

* tidiness has an impact on your energy

### Knowledge and the lack thereof

* when you start asking questions, you often discover that:
    - there's a simple solution
    - there's a web site that handles it
    - there's a professional who takes care of it for a reasonable fee

* most of my problems were caused by my own bad decisions, lack of skill, and
  bad luck, not not being able to find information that I knew I needed

### Don't be an asshole

asshole: anyone who chooses to make the lives of others less pleasant for
reasons that don't appear productive or necessary

Behaviors:

1. Changing the subject to him/herself
2. Dominating conversation
3. Bragging
4. Cheating, lying
5. Disagreeing with any suggestion, no matter how trivial
6. Using honetsy as a justification for cruelty
7. Withholding simple favors out of some warped sense of social justice
8. Abandoning the rules of civil behavior, such as saying hello or making eye
   contact

### Priorities

1. Health
2. Economics: job investments, house
3. Family, friends and lovers
4. Local community
5. Country
6. World

## Managing your attitude

Best way to manage your attitude is by understanding your basic nature as a
moist robot that can be programmers for happiness if you understand the user
interface

* tired people are grumpy, rested people are less so
* exercise, food, and sleep are first buttons to push to elevate your attitude
  and raise your energy

Simple trick: increase your ratio of happy thoughts to disturbing thoughts

* try daydreaming wonderful things in your future
* don't worry that your daydreams are unlikely to come true
* work on projects that have a real chance of changing the world, helping
  humanity, and/or making a billion dollars
* daydream of your idea being a huge success so you can enjoy the feeling

### The power of smiling

* smiling makes you feel better even if your smile is fake

The next time you’re in a gloomy mood, try smiling at a stranger you pass on the street. You’ll be surprised how many people reflexively return the smile, and if you smile often enough, eventually that cue will boot up the happiness subroutine in your brain and release the feel-good chemicals you desire.

### Success premium

* success at anything has a spillover effect on other things
* take advantage of the effect by becoming good at things that require nothing
  but practice
* once you become good at a ew unimportant things (hobbies, sports), habit of
  success stays with you on more important quests

### Pick the delusion that works

* you shouldn't hestitate to modify your perceptions to whatever makes you
  happy, because you're probably wrong about the underlying nature of reality
  anyway.

* I choose to imagine this book will do well because the illusion is highly
  motivating. It increases my energy.

## Affirmations

Affirmations are the practice of repeating to yourself what you want to achieve
while imagining the outcome you want.

Can write it, speak it, or just think it in sentence form.

Typical form: "I, Scott Adams, will become an astronaut".

## Association programming

To change youreslf, part of the solution might involve spending more time with
the people who represent the change you seek

## Happiness

The only reasonable goal in life is maximizing your total lifetime experience of something called happiness.

The single biggest trick for manipulating your happiness chemistyr is being
able to do what you want, *when* you want.

In your personal life and your career, consider schedule flexibility when
making any big decision.

Happiness has more to do with where you're heading than where you are.

It's a good idea to have a sport or hobby that leaves you plenty of room to
improve every year.

*Imagination* is important. If you can't even imagine an improved future, you
won't be happy no matter how well your life is going right now.

Happiness is the natural state for most people whenever they feel healthy, have
flexible schedules, and expect the future to be good.

Primary culprit in bad moods is a deficit in one of the big five:
* flexible schedule
* imagination
* sleep
* diet
* exercise

### Routine

Find great comfort in routine

### Recap

* Eat right.
* Exercise.
* Get enough sleep.
* Imagine an incredible future (even if you don't believe it).
* Work toward a flexible schedule.
* Do things you can steadily improve at.
* Help others (if you've already helped yourself).
* Reduce daily decisions to routine.


## Diet

Simple diet plan that works for me: I eat as much as I want, of anything I
want, whenever I want

Change what you want to eat the right kinds of food for enjoyment

Changing food preferences:
* think of body as a programmable robot as opposed to a fleshy bag full of
  magic

### Look for the pattern

* Ask yourself how you feel at any given moment and then make a mental note of
  waht you ate recently
* simple carbs make the author sleepy: bread, potatoes, white rice
* try and see if they have that effect
* alternately, try: fruits, veggies, nuts, salad, fish, or chicken
* Pasta doesn't make me sleepy and cranky like other simple carbs
* Peanuts and chees satisfy hunger without making me tired

### The food-exercise connection

* food is the fuel that makes exercise possible
* if you manage your diet right, you'll want to exercise more, and that will
  translate into doing so

#### Breaking the simple-carb addiction

* steal willpower from the part of my brain that tries to avoid overeating: eat
  as much as you want of anything that is not a simple carb

### A diet template from your smart(ish) friend

I can eat as much as I want of the foods on this list, and won't gain a pound
as long as I stay active:

* bananas
* protein bars
* peanuts
* mixed nuts
* cheese
* whole wheat pasta
* edamame (soybeans)
* broccoli
* cauliflower
* brussel sprouts
* fish
* lettuce
* tomatoes
* apples
* pears
* carrots
* radishes
* cucumbers
* quinoa
* brown rice
* berries

I also prepare pasta and keep it in the refrigerator, along with veggies
steamed in the microwave. When I want something warm and filling, I just mix
the veggies and pasta, add some butter, microwave the dish for two minutes, and
add pepper and Parmesan cheese.

As I write this, my fridge is full of prepped, healthy food. There are some cut
and washed strawberries and blackberries in one plastic container. Another has
microwaved and cut brussels sprouts. Another has a concoction of quinoa and
brown rice (that comes precooked) mixed with sautéed edamame, carrots, and
broccoli. I literally open the lid, drag a small bowl through it and pop it in
the microwave for two minutes.

We also keep containers of carrots and celery, precut and washed, covered with water, in the fridge.

The trick to eating right is to keep willpower out of the equation for your
diet.

### Know why you're eating

You tend to eat when you don't have enough sleep

When tiredness sparks hunger, try eating peanuts or mixed nuts to suppress
appetite. Cheese also works.

When you eat for social reasons (e.g., somebody else in the kitchen) aim for
the lowest-calorie option (carrots, celery).

### How to make healthy food taste good

Vegetarian flavors:

* Soy sauce
* Cilantro
* Lemon
* Salt
* Pepper
* Butter (or butter substitute)
* Garlic
* Onion
* Curry
* Cheese
* Tomato sauce
* Salsa
* Vegetable broth
* Honey
* Salad dressings
* Balsamic vinegar
* Black-bean sauce
* Hot sauce

### Adjusting your lifestyle for healthy eating

Social influence can make it easier: hanging out with fit peopel can cause you
to become more like them.

### Healthy eating summary

1. Pay attention to your energey level after eating certain foods. Find your
   pattern.
2. Remove uneahlthy, energy-draining food from your home.
3. Stock up on *convenient* healthy food (e.g., apples, nuts, bananas) and let
   laziness be your copilot in eating right.
4. Stop eating foods that create feelings of addiction: white rice, white
   potatoes, desserts, white bread, fried foods.
5. Eat as much healthy food as you want, whenever you want.
6. Get enough sleep, because tiredness creates the illusion of hunger.
7. If your hunger is caused by tiredness, gtry healhty foods with fat, such as
   nuts, avocados, protein bars, and cheese, to suppress the hungry feeling.
8. If you're eating for social reasons only, choose the healthiest options
  with low calories.
9. Learn how to season your healthy-yet-bland foods.
