### Legibility
- arrange population in ways to simplify classic state functions of taxation, conscription, and prevention of rebellion
- central problem in statecraft

### High modernism
- strong version of self-confidence about:
    * scientific progress
    * technical progress
    * expansion of production
    * growing satisfaction of human needs
    * mastery of nature
    * mastery of human natuer

## Introduction

Four elements of tragic episodes of state-inititated social engineering

1. The administrative ordering of nature and society
2. High-modernist ideology
3. Authoritarian state willing to & ale to use full weight of its coercive power to bring high-modernist designs into being
4. Prostrate civil society that lacks the capacity to resist these plans

- indispensable role of practical knowledge, informal processes, and improvisation in the face of uncertainty

- formal schemes of order are untenable without some elements of the practical
  knowledge that they tend to dismiss
