## Ch. 5: How leaders develop

How author improved in pinball.

Ravine-plateau model of growth.

### Practice makes perfect

### The great leap forward

### Falling into the ravine

### Growth in the real world

## Ch. 5: But I can't because

In a well-designed engine, there is no weakest link.

## Ch. 6: The three great obstacles to innovation

1. Self-blindness
2. No-problem syndrome
3. Single-solution belief

### Self-blindness

inability to see ourselves as others see us

### No-problem syndrome

The unshakable belief in your own master intelligence.

One person describes a terribly vexing problem, but the other merely responds
with a callous, "No problem." Responding reflexively with a solution instead of
taking the time to understand the problem.

### Single-solution belief

Belief that there is a single correct solution to a problem

Managers who succumb to this believe there is only one right way for their
reports to do their work.



## Ch. 7: A tool for developing self-awareness

Keep a journal.

Write 5 min a day for 3 months.

Why:

- learn about yourself
- understand what's involved in making a behavioral change (writing each day)
- helps overcome self-blindness, which stands in the way of overcoming other
    obstacles

He's not specific about what to write, but what some people do:

- Write about yourself
- What I'm like
- Facts/feelings/findings
- What I do each day
- How I feel about it
- How I see others reacting to me
- Bugs I encountered
- How I tried to fix them
