This book is about how mechanical engineers use visual representations (sketches, drawings, physical prototypes) as a mechanism to help them think and
communicate with each other, and the impact of introducing computer graphics into their work.

## Chapter 2. Coding and claiming: codification and the rite of engineering as a profession

In engineering, as in other disciplines, the acquisition of theoretical bases and the methodical systemaziation of empirical knowledge evntually defeated apprenticeship, and educators took the lead in efforts at professionalization. p18

Tayor, obsessed with the truth of science but experienced in the stimulating
use of tacit knowledge and multiple ways of knowing involved in shop
innovation and production, attempted to isolate and codify just one aspect of
shop work—kinesthetic or manual knowledge. His intention was to create a technical elite—an altruistic corps with a service ethic—that could stand between labor and capital, advising both of the "one best means" of production, which would be discovered through the scientific method. Maangement, however, adopted a reified and standarized form of the tacit manual knowledge Taken had taken from the shop floor, through time and motion studies, to regulate *all* aspects of work. Such reification—always a danger in any attempt to explain tacit knowledge—dehumanized individual input by destroying initiative and dampening creativity. This was not Taylor's original intention. pp18-19

In textbook problems not only are machine parts stripped away to leave problems that can be dealt with matheamtically, but the real working world of real engineers—a world filled with negotiations, decision-making under uncertainty, and the mixing of engineering principles with social, political, and financial constraints—also disappears. p20

On October 1, 1918, as the War Department agency for educational matters,
CSET [Committee on Education and Special Training] actually took charge of
all colleges of liberal arts, technology, business, agriculture, medicine,
law, pharmacy, dentistry, and veterinary medicine, all graduate schools, and all technical institutes in the United States. p22

## Chapter 3.  The visual culture of engineers: drawing, seeing, and standardizing perception

This chapter talks about drawing conventions in engineering. 




Sketching is essential to getting ideas across. p27

Anyone who has undertaken drawing seriously knows that learning to put what the eye beholds onto paper influences the level of detail one literally sees. p29

Design does not take places through one monolithic rendition. Rather, designers join the immutalbe information of drawings at centers of calculation and collect them into increasing iterations and sets of drawings, in order to hold pieces of information in the absence of the thing itself. The cascade of sketches ultimately made concrete in the final design representations depends on the mobility, stability, and combinability of the representations for extension of the network of participants and information. p33

In the contemporary engineering design, Baynes and Pugh note the emergence of the following typology of drawings: 
* *Designer's drawings* - early sketches and notebooks,
* *Project drawings* - formalized early sketches that show proposals that have been produced according to rules and convetinos, often by the drawing office rather than the engineer,
* *Production drawings* - drawings that display all aspects of design for use in actual production,
* *Presentation and maintenance drawings* - drawings made after the product is finished for use by the customer, and
* *Technical illustrations* - illustrations for popular books that use some conventions of engineering drawing.
p36

Design engineers and drafters may see their design object in many views in their head but eventually reduce these views to the engineering convention of two dimensions on paper. p37

Engineering designers do not follow textbook protocols. they structure their work in an apparently random fashion, moving from one part of the design to another as the ideas flow. pp40 -41

We acquire literacy by learning symbol systems or code. p48

Successful boundary objects exhibit lfexilbity by allowing for mor especific or restricted readings of codes to be embedded within a more universla one. p51


## Chapter 4. The yellow brick road to production: development of a turbine engine package

Information flow is a myth. Information does not flow but rather must be constructed interactively by the human and nonhuman actors involved. Dealing with information is less like floating down a river and more like building a boat. p59

The thesis of this chapter is that the visual communication that takes place between actors in engineering environments is the glue that holds communication together. It allows humans to act collectively toward shared ambitions, to interact with nonhuman actors, and to keep the design and production process close enough to the yellow brick road so that all are not lost by going off in different directions in the woods. pp59-60

Bucciarelli (1994, 111-113) also has noted that the linear flow-charts and
block-diagrams reproduced in engineering textbooks are intended to establish
control but are reductionist and shed little light on how design acts are
actually carried out. They contain no hint of the knowledge or resources that
participants must bring to the task, the ways in which participants must
collaborate, or the symbiotic relationship that exists between the machine
and the organization.

The empricially informed focus on process challenges the notion of information flow, showing instead the hard work of making tacit knowledge visible so that those involved can engineer a competent design. p60
