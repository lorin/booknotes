## Outline

1. Introduction
2. Coding and claiming: codification and the rite of engineering as a profession
  * codified knowledge as a basis for the professions
  * standardization and codification in engineering history
  * Taylorism and the rage to codify, classify, and bureaucratize
3. The visual culture of engineres: drawing, seeing, and standardizing perception
4. The yellow brick road to productio: development of a turbine engine package
5. The political career of a protoytpe: development of a precision medical instrument
6. Computer graphics in design engineering: how and why changes in visual culture cause restructing
7. Mixed-use practices: combining the electronic world and the paper world
8. The aura of "high tech" in a world of messy practice: standardization, mystification, and glamour
9. The power of visual representations: mixed practices, multivisual competencies, and meta-indexicals



## Chapter 2

In engineering, as in other disciplines, the acquisition of theoretical bases and the methodical systemaziation of empirical knowledge evntually defeated apprenticeship, and educators took the lead in efforts at professionalization. p18

Tayor, obsessed with the truth of science but experienced in the stimulating
use of tacit knowledge and multiple ways of knowing involved in shop
innovation and production, attempted to isolate and codify just one aspect of
shop work—kinesthetic or manual knowledge. His intention was to create a technical elite—an altruistic corps with a service ethic—that could stand between labor and capital, advising both of the "one best means" of production, which would be discovered through the scientific method. Maangement, however, adopted a reified and standarized form of the tacit manual knowledge Taken had taken from the shop floor, through time and motion studies, to regulate *all* aspects of work. Such reification—always a danger in any attempt to explain tacit knowledge—dehumanized individual input by destroying initiative and dampening creativity. This was not Taylor's original intention. pp18-19

In textbook problems not only are machine parts stripped away to leave problems that can be dealt with matheamtically, but the real working world of real engineers—a world filled with negotiations, decision-making under uncertainty, and the mixing of engineering principles with social, political, and financial constraints—also disappears.
