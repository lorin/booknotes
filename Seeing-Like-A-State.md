## Quotes

I am, however, making a case against an imperial or hegemonic planning mentality that excludes the necessary role of local knowledge and know-how.

[F]ormal schemes of order are untenable without some elements of the practical knowledge that they tend to dismiss.

The simplification of measures, however, depended on that other revolutionary
political simplification of the modern era: the concept of a uniform,
homogeneous citizenship.

Customs are better understood as a living, negotiated tissue of practices which
are continually being adapted to new ecological and social
circumstances—including, of course, power relations.

Administrative man recognizes that the world he perceives is a drastically
simplified model of the buzzing, blooming confusion that constitutes the real
world. He is content with the gross simplification because he believes that the
real world is mostly empty—that most of the facts of the real world have no
great relevance to any particular situation he is facing and that most
significant chains of causes and consequences are short and simple.
—Herbert Simon

The door-and-window tax established in France under the Directory and abolished
only in 1917 is a striking case in point. Its originator must have reasoned
that the number of windows and doors in a dwelling was proportional to the
dwelling’s size. Thus a tax assessor need not enter the house or measure it but
merely count the doors and windows. As a simple, workable formula, it was a
brilliant stroke, but it was not without consequences. Peasant dwellings were
subsequently designed or renovated with the formula in mind so as to have as
few openings as possible. While the fiscal losses could be recouped by raising
the tax per opening, the long-term effects on the health of the rural
population lasted for more than a century.

The development of the personal surname (literally, a name added to another
name, and not to be confused with a permanent patronym) went hand in hand with
the development of written, official documents such as tithe records, manorial
dues rolls, marriage registers, censuses, tax records, and land records.

Combining several metrics of aggregation, one arrives at quite subtle, complex,
heretofore unknown truths, including, for example, the distribution of
tubercular patients by income and urban location.

Three factors [to resisting authoritarian temptations of twentieth-century high
modernism] seem decisive. The first is the existence and belief in a private
sphere of activity in which the state and its agencies may not legitimately
interfere. ... The second, closely related factor is the private sector in
liberal political economy.  ... The third and by far most important barrier to
thoroughgoing high-modernist schemes has been the existence of working,
representative institutions through which a resistant society could make its
influence felt.

High modernism implies, as we have seen, a rejection of the past as a model to
improve upon and a desire to make a completely fresh start.

Integral, finally, to Le Corbusier’s ultramodernism was his repudiation of
tradition, history, and received taste. After explaining the origin of the
traffic congestion in contemporary Paris, he warned against temptations to
reform. “We must refuse even the slightest consideration to what is: to the
mess we are in now.” He emphasized, “There is no solution to be found here.”
Instead, he insisted, we must take a “blank piece of paper,” a “clean
tablecloth,” and start new calculations from zero.

“To see complex systems of functional order as order, and not as chaos, takes
understanding. The leaves dropping from the trees in the autumn, the interior
of an airplane engine, the entrails of a rabbit, the city desk of a newspaper,
all appear to be chaos if they are seen without comprehension. Once they are
seen as systems of order, they actually look different.” - Jane Jacobs

For Jacobs, the city as a social organism is a living structure that is
constantly changing and springing surprises. Its interconnections are so
complex and dimly understood that planning always risks unknowingly cutting
into its living tissue, thereby damaging or killing vital social processes.

Just as it saves a prison trouble and money if all prisoners wear uniforms of
the same material, color, and size, every concession to diversity is likely to
entail a corresponding increase in administrative time and budgetary cost. If
the planning authority does not need to make concessions to popular desires,
the one-size-fits-all solution is likely to prevail.

The historic diversity of the city—the source of its value and magnetism—is an unplanned creation of many hands and long historical practice.

The best a planner can hope for is to modestly enhance rather than impede the development
of urban complexity.

Strong neighborhoods, like strong cities, are the product of complex processes that cannot be replicated from above.

Lenin and Le Corbusier, notwithstanding the great disparity in their training and purpose, shared some basic elements of the high-modernist outlook. While the scientific pretensions of each may seem implausible to us, they both believed in the existence of a master science that served as the claim to authority of a small planning elite.

Their confidence in their method meant that neither the science of designing cities nor that of designing revolutions had much to learn from the existing practices and values of their intended beneficiaries.

The parallels serve as a reminder of the extent to which much of the socialist left as well as the right were in thrall to the template of modern industrial organization.

High modernism was politically polymorphous; it could appear in any political disguise, even an anarchist one.

When contrasting her understanding to Lenin’s, she consistently reached for metaphors from complex, organic processes, which cannot be arbitrarily carved up without threatening the vitality of the organism itself.

Finally, we must frankly admit to ourselves that the errors made by a truly revolutionary labor movement are historically infinitely more fruitful and valuable than the infallibility of the best of all possible ‘central committees’

The experts would serve the producers rather than dictating to them.

“To be ruled is to be kept an eye on, inspected, spied on, regulated,
indoctrinated, sermonized, listed and checked off, estimated, appraised,
censured, ordered about. … To be ruled is at every operation, transaction,
movement, to be noted, registered, counted, priced, admonished, prevented,
reformed, redressed, corrected.” - Pierre-Joseph Proudhon

Most states, to speak broadly, are “younger” than the societies that they
purport to administer. States therefore confront patterns of settlement, social
relations, and production, not to mention a natural environment, that have
evolved largely independent of state plans.

If the state’s goals are minimal, it may not need to know much about the
society. Just as a woodsman who takes only an occasional load of firewood from
a large forest need have no detailed knowledge of that forest, so a state whose
demands are confined to grabbing a few carts of grain and the odd conscript may
not require a very accurate or detailed map of the society. If, however, the
state is ambitious—if it wants to extract as much grain and manpower as it can,
short of provoking a famine or a rebellion, if it wants to create a literate,
skilled, and healthy population, if it wants everyone to speak the same
language or worship the same god—then it will have to become both far more
knowledgeable and far more intrusive.

A major objective of would-be rulers was to create and then expand state spaces
by building irrigation works, capturing subjects in wars, forcing settlement,
codifying religions, and so on. The classical state envisaged a concentrated
population, within easy range, producing a steady supply of easily
transportable, storable grain and tribute and providing a surplus of manpower
for security, war, and public works.

In certain vital respects, Soviet high modernism is not a sharp break from
Russian absolutism. Ernest Gellner has argued that of the two facets of the
Enlightenment—the one asserting the sovereignty of the individual and his
interests, the other commending the rational authority of experts—it was the
second that spoke to rulers who wanted their “backward” states to catch up. The
Enlightenment arrived in Central Europe, he concludes, as a “centralizing
rather than a liberating force.”

As we shall see, it resembled Brasília in being the kind of failure typical of
ambitious high-modernist schemes for which local knowledge, practice, and
context are considered irrelevant or at best an annoyance to be circumvented.

At another level, collectivization was, in a curious state-centric way, a
qualified success. Collectivization proved a rough-and-ready instrument for the
twin goals

Scholars who agree on little else are in accord on this point: the overriding
purpose of collectivization was to ensure the seizure of grain.

High-modernist ideologies embody a doctrinal preference for certain social
arrangements. Authoritarian high-modernist states, on the other hand, take the
next step. They attempt, and often succeed, in imposing those preferences on
their population.

As in the “unimproved” forest, the existing patterns of settlement and social
life in Tanzania were illegible and resistant to the narrow purposes of the
state. Only by radically simplifying the settlement pattern was it possible for
the state to efficiently deliver such development services as schools, clinics,
and clean water.

The thinly veiled subtext of villagization was also to reorganize human
communities in order to make them better objects of political control and to
facilitate the new forms of communal farming favored by state policy.

As in the Soviet case, there was also, I believe, a powerful aesthetic dimension.

High-modernist plans tend to “travel” as an abbreviated visual image of
efficiency that is less a scientific proposition to be tested than a
quasi-religious faith in a visual sign or representation of order.

[T]he assumption is that if the arrangement looks right, it will also, ipso facto, function well.

For ideological reasons, the designers of the new society had paid virtually no
attention to the local knowledge and practices of cultivators and pastoralists.
They had also forgotten the most important fact about social engineering: its
efficiency depends on the response and cooperation of real human subjects. If
people find the new arrangement, however efficient in principle, to be hostile
to their dignity, their plans, and their tastes, they can make it an
inefficient arrangement.

The point of departure for colonial policy was a complete faith in what
officials took for “scientific agriculture” on one hand and a nearly total
skepticism about the actual agricultural practices of Africans on the other.

Although the officer’s sentiment was no doubt perfectly sincere, one cannot
fail to note how it justified, at the same time, the importance and authority
of agricultural experts over mere practitioners.

...by Nyerere’s underlying conviction that the peasants did not know what was good for them.

That premise was that the practices of African cultivators and pastoralists
were backward, unscientific, inefficient, and ecologically irresponsible. Only
close supervision, training, and, if need be, coercion by specialists in
scientific agriculture could bring them and their practices in line with a
modern Tanzania. They were the problem to which the agricultural experts were
the solution.

I stress two key elements of the bureaucratic response typified by the ujamaa
village campaign: first, the civil servants’ inclination to reinterpret the
campaign so that it called for results that they could more easily deliver, and
second, their disposition to reinterpret the campaign in line with what was in
their corporate interests.

High-modernist social engineering is ideal soil for authoritarian pretensions,
and Tanzanian officialdom made the most of this chance to consolidate its
position.

The existing economic activity and physical movement of the Tanzanian rural
population were the consequences of a mind-bogglingly complex, delicate, and
pliable set of adaptations to their diverse social and material environment.

The failure of ujamaa villages was almost guaranteed by the highmodernist
hubris of planners and specialists who believed that they alone knew how to
organize a more satisfactory, rational, and productive life for their citizens.
It should be noted that they did have something to contribute to what could
have been a more fruitful development of the Tanzanian countryside. But their
insistence that they had a monopoly on useful knowledge and that they impose
this knowledge set the stage for disaster.

Resettlement was far more than a change in scenery. It took people from a
setting in which they had the skills and resources to produce many of their own
basic needs and hence the means of a reasonably self- sufficient independence.
It then transferred them to a setting where these skills were of little or no avail.

Because the bearers of this visual codification saw themselves as
self-conscious modernizers of their societies, their vision required a sharp
and morally loaded contrast between what looked modern (tidy rectilinear,
uniform, concentrated, simplified, mechanized) and what looked primitive
(irregular, dispersed, complicated, unmechanized).

It is far easier for would-be reformers to change the formal structure of an
institution than to change its practices.

A village, city, or language is the jointly created, partly unintended product
of many, many hands.  To the degree that authorities insist on replacing this
ineffably complex web of activity with formal rules and regulations, they are
certain to disrupt the web in ways that they cannot possibly foresee.

Nearly every new, exemplary capital city has, as the inevitable accompaniment
of its official structures, given rise to another, far more “disorderly” and
complex city that makes the official city work—that is virtually a condition of
its existence.

On a more speculative note, I imagine that the greater the pretense of and
insistence on an officially decreed micro-order, the greater the volume of
nonconforming practices necessary to sustain that fiction.

The necessarily simple abstractions of large bureaucratic institutions, as we
have seen, can never adequately represent the actual complexity of natural or
social processes.

Like the formal order of the planned section of Brasília or collectivized
agriculture, modern, simplified, and standardized agriculture depends for its
existence on a “dark twin” of informal practices and experience on which it is,
ultimately, parasitic.

Above all, they believed in large, integrated, planned projects rather than
piecemeal improvements, partly because the large, capital-intensive schemes
could be planned as nearly pure technical exercises, rather like the design of
the Soviet collective farm that was invented in a Chicago hotel room.

Given their visual codification of modern agricultural practice, most
specialists knew, without further empirical investigation, that the apparent
disorder of the crops was a symptom of backward techniques; it failed the
visual test of scientific agriculture.

the resilience and durability of diversity.

All environments, as we noted earlier, are intractably local. There is always
what we might call the translation problem in converting the generic,
standardized High Church Latin which emanates from labs and experimental
stations into the vernacular of the local parish. Standardized solutions to
field preparation, planting schedules, and fertilizer requirements always have
to be adjusted when they are applied to, say, a stony, low-lying, north-facing
field which has just grown two crops of oats. Agricultural scientists at
research stations and extension agents are very much aware of this translation
problem, as are specialists in any applied science. The question is always how
to discover and convey findings so that they will be helpful to farmers. As
long as the findings or solutions are not simply imposed, the farmer must
decide if they meet his needs.

The logical companion to a complete faith in a quasi-industrial model of
highmodernist agriculture was an often explicit contempt for the practices of
actual cultivators and what might be learned from them.

We have repeatedly observed the natural and social failures of thin, formulaic
simplifications imposed through the agency of state power.

Formal order, to be more explicit, is always and to some considerable degree
parasitic on informal processes, which the formal scheme does not recognize,
without which it could not exist, and which it alone cannot create or maintain.

Four elements of tragic episodes of state-inititated social engineering

1. The administrative ordering of nature and society
2. High-modernist ideology
3. Authoritarian state willing to & ale to use full weight of its coercive power to bring high-modernist designs into being
4. Prostrate civil society that lacks the capacity to resist these plans

- indispensable role of practical knowledge, informal processes, and improvisation in the face of uncertainty

- formal schemes of order are untenable without some elements of the practical
  knowledge that they tend to dismiss

## Ch. 1: Nature and space


## Ch. 2: Cities, people, and language

### Surnames

By roughly 4th century BC, Qin dynasty had begun imposing surnames on much of
its population & enumerating them for purposes of taxes, forced labor, and
conscription.

Until at least 14th century, majority of Europeans did not have permanent
patronymics.
