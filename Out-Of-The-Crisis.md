# Out of the crisis by W. Edward Deming

## The deadly diseases

1. Lack of constancy of purpose to plan product and service that have a market
   and keep the company in business, and provide jobs.
2. Emphasis on short-term profits: short-term thinking
3. Evaluation of performance, merit rating, or annual review.
4. Mobility of management; job hopping.
5. Management by use only of visible figures, with little or no consideration
   of figures that are unknown or unknowable.
6. Excessive medical costs.
7. Excessive costs of liability, swelled by lawyers that work on contingency
  fes.

(Last two are U.S. specific).

## 14 points for management

1. Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service, with
   the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs.
2. Adopt the new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. Western management
   must awaken to teh challenge, learn their responsibilites, and take on
   leadership for change.
3. Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality. Elminate the need for
   inspection on a mass basis by building quality into the product in the first
   place.
4. End the practice of awarding business osn the basis of price tag. Instead,
  minimize total cost. Move toward a single supplier for any one item, on a
  long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.
5. Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service, to
   improve quality and productivity, and thus constantly decrease costs.
6. Institute training on the job.
7. Institute leadership. The aim of supervision should be to help people and
   machines and gadgets do a better job. Supervision of management is in need
   of overhaul, as well as superivison of production workers.
8. Drive out fear, so that everyone may work effectively for the company.
9. Break down barriers between departments. People in research, design, sales,
   and production must work as a team, to foresee problems of production and in
   use that may be encountered with the product or service.
10. Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking
   for zero defects and new levels of productivity. Such exhortations only
   create adversarial relationships, as the bulk of the causes of low
   quality and low productivity belong to the system and thus lie beyond
   the power of the work force.
11. a. Eliminate work standards (quotas) on the factory floor. Substitute
    leadership.
    b. Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers,
    numerical goals. Substitute leadership.
12. a. Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of
    workmanshp. The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer
    numbers to quality.
    b. Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of
    their right to pride of workmanship. This means, *inter alia*, abolishment
    of the annual or merit rating and of management by objective.
13. Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement.
14. Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. The
    transformation is everybody's job.


## Notable quotes

Focus on outcome (management by numbers, MBO, work standards, meet
specifications, zero defects, appraisal of performance) must be abolished,
leadership put in place. (p54)

We mistrust the management. We can’t believe their answers when we ask why we do it this way. The management have a reason, but tell us something else. (p61)

Goals are necessary for you and for me, but numerical goals set for other people, without a road map to reach the goal, have effects opposite to the effects sought. (p69)

Eliminate numerical quotas for the work force. (p70)

She must bury her pride of workmanship to make her quota, or lose pay and maybe also her job. (p72)

Work standards, rates, incentive pay, and piece work are manifestations of inability to understand and provide appropriate supervision. (p72)

If you have a stable system, then there is no use to specify a goal. You will get whatever the system will deliver. A goal beyond the capability of the system will not be reached. (p76)

To manage, one must lead. To lead, one must understand the work that he and his people are responsible for. (p76)

He must learn from his people what they are doing and must learn a lot of new subject matter. (p76)

Focus on outcome is not an effective way to improve a process or an activity. (p76)

[M]anagement by numerical goal is an attempt to manage without knowledge of what to do, and in fact is usually management by fear. (p76)

The only number that is permissible for a manager to dangle in front of his people is a plain statement of fact with respect to survival. (p76)

Barriers against realization of pride of workmanship may in fact be one of the most important obstacles to reduction of cost and improvement of quality in the United States. (p83)

Foremen do not have sufficient knowledge to give leadership. (p84)

"I do not know how my performance is measured. The merit rating is a farce." (p84)

In my experience, people can face almost any problem except the problems of people. (p85)

The possibility of pride of workmanship means more to the production worker than gymnasiums, tennis courts, and recreation areas. (p85)

People require in their careers, more than money, ever-broadening opportunities to add something to society, materially and otherwise. (p86)

At successive sessions, people may tear up what they did in the previous session and make a fresh start with clearer ideas. This is a sign of advancement. (p90)

A group, a team, should have an aim, a job, a goal. A statement thereof must not be specific in detail, else it stifle initiative. (p90)

How do you know if you produce good results or poor results; i.e., are there standards or criteria of good performance? (p91)

My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.—Hosea 4:6. (p97)

Merit rating rewards people that do well in the system. It does not reward attempts to improve the system. Don’t rock the boat. (p102)

Counts relieve management of the necessity to contrive a measure with meaning. (p105)

Unfortunately, people that are measured by counting are deprived of pride of workmanship. (p105)

A good rating for work on new product and new service that may generate new
business five or eight years hence, and provide better material living,
requires enlightened management. He that engages in such work would study
changes in education, changes in style of living, migration in and out of urban
areas. He would attend meetings of the American Sociological Society, the
Business Section of the American Statistical Association, the American
Marketing Association. He would write professional papers to deliver at such
meetings, all of which are necessary for the planning of product and service of
the future. He would not for years have anything to show for his labors.
Meanwhile, in the absence of enlightened management, other people getting good
ratings on short-run projects would leave him behind. (p106)

[A]pparent differences between people arise almost entirely from action of the system that they work in, not from the people themselves. (p110)

A leader, instead of being a judge, will be a colleague, counseling and leading his people on a day-to-day basis, learning from them and with them. (p117)

Actually, the most important figures that one needs for management are unknown or unknowable (Lloyd S. Nelson, p. 20), but successful management must nevertheless take account of them. (p121)
