# Out of the crisis by W. Edward Deming

## The deadly diseases

1. Lack of constancy of purpose to plan product and service that have a market
   and keep the company in business, and provide jobs.
2. Emphasis on short-term profits: short-term thinking
3. Evaluation of performance, merit rating, or annual review.
4. Mobility of management; job hopping.
5. Management by use only of visible figures, with little or no consideration
   of figures that are unknown or unknowable.
6. Excessive medical costs.
7. Excessive costs of liability, swelled by lawyers that work on contingency
  fes.

(Last two are U.S. specific).

## 14 points for management

1. Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service, with
   the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs.
2. Adopt the new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. Western management
   must awaken to teh challenge, learn their responsibilites, and take on
   leadership for change.
3. Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality. Elminate the need for
   inspection on a mass basis by building quality into the product in the first
   place.
4. End the practice of awarding business osn the basis of price tag. Instead,
  minimize total cost. Move toward a single supplier for any one item, on a
  long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.
5. Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service, to
   improve quality and productivity, and thus constantly decrease costs.
6. Institute training on the job.
7. Institute leadership. The aim of supervision should be to help people and
   machines and gadgets do a better job. Supervision of management is in need
   of overhaul, as well as superivison of production workers.
8. Drive out fear, so that everyone may work effectively for the company.
9. Break down barriers between departments. People in research, design, sales,
   and production must work as a team, to foresee problems of production and in
   use that may be encountered with the product or service.
10. Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking
   for zero defects and new levels of productivity. Such exhortations only
   create adversarial relationships, as the bulk of the causes of low
   quality and low productivity belong to the system and thus lie beyond
   the power of the work force.
11. a. Eliminate work standards (quotas) on the factory floor. Substitute
    leadership.
    b. Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers,
    numerical goals. Substitute leadership.
12. a. Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of
    workmanshp. The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer
    numbers to quality.
    b. Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of
    their right to pride of workmanship. This means, *inter alia*, abolishment
    of the annual or merit rating and of management by objective.
13. Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement.
14. Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. The
    transformation is everybody's job.
