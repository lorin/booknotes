## Criteria for a complex system

1. Complex systems consist of a large number of elements.
2. The elements have to interact, and this interaction must be dynamic: a complex system changes with time.
3. The interaction is fairly rich.
4. The interactions are non-linear.
5. The interactions usually have a fairly short range: information is received primarily from immediate neighbors.
6. There are loops in the interactions.
7. Complex systems are usually open systems.
8. Complex systems operate under conditions far from equilibrium.
9. Complex systems have a history.
10. Each element in the system is ignorant of the behavior of the system as a whole, it responds only to information that is available to it locally.

## Attributes of self-organizing systems (p91)

1. Structure is a result of interaction between system and its environment.
2. Internal structure of system can adapt dynamically to changes in the environment.
3. Self-organization is the result of higher-order, non-linear processes.
4. Self-organization is an emergent property of a system as a whole. Individual components only operate on local information & general principles.
5. Self-organizing systems increase in complexity.
6. Self-organization is impossible without some form of memory. A self-organising system therefore always has a history. This diachronic component cannot be ignored in any description of the system since previous conditions of the system form vital influences on present behavior.
7. The notion of function is intimately linked to our *descriptions* of complex systems. You can only really talk about the function of a system in the context of a larger system that it forms a part of.
8. The various 'levels' of the system cannot be given independent descriptions. The levels are in principle intertwined.

## Ch. 3: Post-structuralism, connectionism and complexity

* Introduces post-structuralism
* Points out relevance of post-structuralism for study of complex systems

* Saussure proposed theory of language
* theory criticised & developd by Derrida

* post-structural inquiry into nature of language is based on system of relationships

* connectionist networks can be used to model general conceputalisation of how relationships in complex systems interact with time


### Central argument of book
* complexity best characterised as arising through large-scale, non-linear interaction
* dynamics that generates meaning in language can be used to describe dynamics of complex systems
* connectionist networks can be used as general models for complex systems


### Saussure's model of language

main concern was meaning of language

language consists of # of discrete units: signs

sign consists of two components
* signifier
* signified

these are not separable entities

Example: tree
* word 'tree' is the signifier
* concept of tree would be signified
* together they form the sign for tree

two primordial characteristics:
1. no *natural* link between signifier and signified
2. sign unfolds linearly in time

signs are both mutable and immutable

system of language transcends choice of any individual user, therefore has stability

system perpetuates itself in a way that guarentees integrity: Saussure calls this "the stacked deck"

mutable: signs change over time

contradiction is result of arbitrary nature of the sign

General distinctions Saussure makes:
* signifier / signified
* synchronic / diachronic
* morphological / phonological
* syntagmatic / paradigmatic

syntagmatic relations: concern specific *sequence* in which # of linguistic signs are used to form a sentnece

paradigmatic relations: those which apply between a sign & all other signs that coudl replace it

Saussure insists on primacy of spoken language over written language

writing is but an image of signs which find their true manifestation in spoken form

### Language as a system of signifiers only

Saussure introduce system of language in which linguistic comonents are not assigned identify by means of rules, but derive their meaning from their relationships with all the other components

Harland describes it as a 'simultaneous system': 
* the system only balances if words push against each other at exactly the same time

Harland also described as a 'total' system, system only balances if:
* no internal gaps to give words room for failing
* no surrounding void to give words room for dispersing

words need to be packed up tightly together within a closed space

Saussure understands language as a system in which every words has its place, and, consequently, its meaning. System does not evolve, but remains in a state near equilibrium.

However, complex systems, like language, do not operate near equilibrium: relationships between components of system are non-lienar & dynamic

Signs in complex system always have an excess of meaning, with only some of the potential meaning realised in specific situations

#### Derrida's critique of Saussure

Derrida critiques 'metaphysics of presence', tendency in whole tradition of western philosophy

* Saussure insists that the *signified* is mental/psychological
* this implies that meaning of a sign is *present* to speaker when he uses it
* but this contradicts fact that meaning is constituted by a system of differences

### Networks and systems


## Ch. 5 Problems with representation

### Questions

How does a word in a language represent something? 

How do experts represent tehir knowledge?

Does a pattern contain certain explict features that can be represented in a pattern-recognition machine?

What is the relationship between the structure of the network and the phenomena that caused it?

How does a network represent the information of the domain it models?

Is it possible to analyze the structure of a successful network in order to determine how it solved the problem?

How do you use a priori knowledge ot predtermine the structure of a network, should such implementation 

## Ch. 6 Self-organization in complex systems

Chapter focus: how structure of complex systems:
* comes about
* develops
* changes

structure is the result of a complex interaction between:
* the environment
* the present state of the system 
* the history of the system

### Key aspects

#### Towards a sdefinition of self-organization

Working definition of self-organization:

*The capacity for self-organization is a property of complex systems which enables them to develop or change internal structuer spontaneously and adaptively in order to cope with, or manipulate, their environment.*

Examples: cell, brain, language, economic sytem of a country

Brain has ability to *learn*, thus necessaray changes in structure eanble brain to *remember* what has been learnt.

### Attributes of self-organizing systems

1. Structure is a result of interaction between system and its environment.
2. Internal structure of system can adapt dynamically to changes in the environment.
3. Self-organization is the result of higher-order, non-linear processes.
4. Self-organization is an emergent property of a system as a whole. Individual components only operate on local information & general principles.
5. Self-organizing systems increase in complexity.
6. Self-organization is impossible without some form of memory. A self-organising system therefore always has a history. This diachronic component cannot be ignored in any description of the system since previous conditions of the system form vital influences on present behavior.
7. The notion of function is intimately linked to our *descriptions* of complex systems. You can only really talk about the function of a system in the context of a larger system that it forms a part of.
8. The various 'levels' of the system cannot be given independent descriptions. The levels are in principle intertwined.


#### Basic principles of self-organization

1. System consists of *large* number of microscopic elements of units that are *relatively undifferentiated initially*.
2. Strengths of interconnections change as a result of *local information* only. These changes are often self-maintaining & cause system to move away from undifferentiated state.
3. There is *competition* among the units. Competing for limited resources is basic driving force behind the development of structure.
4. There is also *co-operation* among at least some units.
5. The interactions among unit have to be *non-linear*.
6. *symmetry-breaking*: if initial state is fully homogeneous, evolving structure could be too symmetrical.
7. *entrainment*: some patterns will catch others in their wake in the sense that they will start appearing in concert.
8. the memory of the system is stored in a distributed fashion.

### Self-organized criticality


the mechanism that leads to minor events is the same one that leads to major events.

the system organizes itself towards the critical point where single events have the widest possible range of effects. The system tunes itself towards optimum sensitivity to external inputs.

### Organisation through selection

To interepret its environment, system must have two attributes:
* some form of resistance to change
* mechanism for comparing different conditions in order to determine whether there has been en ough change to warrant som eresponse

biological systems encounter constraints
* need to adapt to complex conditions
* must respond quickly enough

#### Learning through selection

Two ways system can respond to environment:
* instructive mechanism: environment imposes order directly on system structure
* selective (Darwinian) mechanism: increase in order rseults from interactionb etween system and environment

c.f. supervised vs unsupervised learning

#### Neural group selection

Brain self-organizes based on three principles

1. selective processes
2. interaction bewteen the system and ethe environment
3. loops & feedback

aspects of cortical map formation:
1. group confinement - neural groups have an optimum size, which is not known a priori
2. group selection - c.f. Hebb's rule
3. group competition -stability of groups determined by competitive interaction with other groups


#### The relatinoship between the brain and the world

Structure of the brain does not become a mirror of the environment, because:
1. effects are delayed
2. different impulses are always mixed as a result of the fact that the groups are embedded in a network.

Role of motor behavior: available info is also determined by the way in which the organism actively explores its environment.

Structure of the brain is strongly influenced by action.

Intelligence not an abstract process, it is embedded. Brains are part of our bodies.

Structures for communication remain embedded in a neural structure, and therefore will always be subjected to teh complexities of network interaction.

### Philosophical implications of self-organization

#### Importance of relationships and patterns

Self-organization argues against:
* foundationalism (single origin, immutable principle)
* reductionism

postmernism denies single metta-narratives, emphasizes difference & opposition

#### The role of history

No complex system, whether biological or social, can be understood without considering its history. 

History co-determines the structure of the system

history is not present in the system in such a way that it can be reconstructed.

global behavior of the system is the result of *patterns of traces*

#### Active and passive

self-organization is suspended between active & passive modes

reflexivity: self-organization is a self-transforming process; the system acts upon itself.

#### Stability and prediction





### Lorin's personal observations

Reminded of Woods's notions of:
* constraints
* finite resources
* reciprocity


Starting with large number of relatively undifferentiated units: not sure how much that applies. Although, in a sense, if you think of an organization made up of people,
it's true that a start-up is sort of a clump of people, and then it grows and specializes into organizational structures. Similar with competition between groups.

Hard to see how this applies to language, though.
