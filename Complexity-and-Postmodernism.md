# Complexity and postmodernism

Uses artificial neural networks as a model for complex systems.

A lot about meaning and representation, because of analogies to language.

## Ch. 3: Post-structuralism, connectionism and complexity

* Introduces post-structuralism
* Points out relevance of post-structuralism for study of complex systems

* Saussure proposed theory of language
* theory criticised & developd by Derrida

* post-structural inquiry into nature of language is based on system of relationships

* connectionist networks can be used to model general conceputalisation of how relationships in complex systems interact with time


### Central argument of book
* complexity best characterised as arising through large-scale, non-linear interaction
* dynamics that generates meaning in language can be used to describe dynamics of complex systems
* connectionist networks can be used as general models for complex systems


### Saussure's model of language

main concern was meaning of language

language consists of # of discrete units: signs

sign consists of two components
* signifier
* signified

these are not separable entities

Example: tree
* word 'tree' is the signifier
* concept of tree would be signified
* together they form the sign for tree

two primordial characteristics:
1. no *natural* link between signifier and signified
2. sign unfolds linearly in time

signs are both mutable and immutable

system of language transcends choice of any individual user, therefore has stability

system perpetuates itself in a way that guarentees integrity: Saussure calls this "the stacked deck"

mutable: signs change over time

contradiction is result of arbitrary nature of the sign

General distinctions Saussure makes:
* signifier / signified
* synchronic / diachronic
* morphological / phonological
* syntagmatic / paradigmatic

syntagmatic relations: concern specific *sequence* in which # of linguistic signs are used to form a sentnece

paradigmatic relations: those which apply between a sign & all other signs that coudl replace it

Saussure insists on primacy of spoken language over written language

writing is but an image of signs which find their true manifestation in spoken form

### Language as a system of signifiers only

Saussure introduce system of language in which linguistic comonents are not assigned identify by means of rules, but derive their meaning from their relationships with all the other components

Harland describes it as a 'simultaneous system': 
* the system only balances if words push against each other at exactly the same time

Harland also described as a 'total' system, system only balances if:
* no internal gaps to give words room for failing
* no surrounding void to give words room for dispersing

words need to be packed up tightly together within a closed space

Saussure understands language as a system in which every words has its place, and, consequently, its meaning. System does not evolve, but remains in a state near equilibrium.

However, complex systems, like language, do not operate near equilibrium: relationships between components of system are non-lienar & dynamic

Signs in complex system always have an excess of meaning, with only some of the potential meaning realised in specific situations

#### Derrida's critique of Saussure

Derrida critiques 'metaphysics of presence', tendency in whole tradition of western philosophy

* Saussure insists that the *signified* is mental/psychological
* this implies that meaning of a sign is *present* to speaker when he uses it
* but this contradicts fact that meaning is constituted by a system of differences
