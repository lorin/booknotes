## Criteria for a complex system

1. Complex systems consist of a large number of elements.
2. The elements have to interact, and this interaction must be dynamic: a complex system changes with time.
3. The interaction is fairly rich.
4. The interactions are non-linear.
5. The interactions usually have a fairly short range: information is received primarily from immediate neighbors.
6. There are loops in the interactions.
7. Complex systems are usually open systems.
8. Complex systems operate under conditions far from equilibrium.
9. Complex systems have a history.
10. Each element in the system is ignorant of the behavior of the system as a whole, it responds only to information that is available to it locally.

## Attributes of self-organizing systems (p91)

1. Structure is a result of interaction between system and its environment.
2. Internal structure of system can adapt dynamically to changes in the environment.
3. Self-organization is the result of higher-order, non-linear processes.
4. Self-organization is an emergent property of a system as a whole. Individual components only operate on local information & general principles.
5. Self-organizing systems increase in complexity.
6. Self-organization is impossible without some form of memory. A self-organising system therefore always has a history. This diachronic component cannot be ignored in any description of the system since previous conditions of the system form vital influences on present behavior.
7. The notion of function is intimately linked to our *descriptions* of complex systems. You can only really talk about the function of a system in the context of a larger system that it forms a part of.
8. The various 'levels' of the system cannot be given independent descriptions. The levels are in principle intertwined.

## Ch. 3: Post-structuralism, connectionism and complexity

* Introduces post-structuralism
* Points out relevance of post-structuralism for study of complex systems

* Saussure proposed theory of language
* theory criticised & developd by Derrida

* post-structural inquiry into nature of language is based on system of relationships

* connectionist networks can be used to model general conceputalisation of how relationships in complex systems interact with time


### Central argument of book
* complexity best characterised as arising through large-scale, non-linear interaction
* dynamics that generates meaning in language can be used to describe dynamics of complex systems
* connectionist networks can be used as general models for complex systems


### Saussure's model of language

main concern was meaning of language

language consists of # of discrete units: signs

sign consists of two components
* signifier
* signified

these are not separable entities

Example: tree
* word 'tree' is the signifier
* concept of tree would be signified
* together they form the sign for tree

two primordial characteristics:
1. no *natural* link between signifier and signified
2. sign unfolds linearly in time

signs are both mutable and immutable

system of language transcends choice of any individual user, therefore has stability

system perpetuates itself in a way that guarentees integrity: Saussure calls this "the stacked deck"

mutable: signs change over time

contradiction is result of arbitrary nature of the sign

General distinctions Saussure makes:
* signifier / signified
* synchronic / diachronic
* morphological / phonological
* syntagmatic / paradigmatic

syntagmatic relations: concern specific *sequence* in which # of linguistic signs are used to form a sentnece

paradigmatic relations: those which apply between a sign & all other signs that coudl replace it

Saussure insists on primacy of spoken language over written language

writing is but an image of signs which find their true manifestation in spoken form

### Language as a system of signifiers only

Saussure introduce system of language in which linguistic comonents are not assigned identify by means of rules, but derive their meaning from their relationships with all the other components

Harland describes it as a 'simultaneous system': 
* the system only balances if words push against each other at exactly the same time

Harland also described as a 'total' system, system only balances if:
* no internal gaps to give words room for failing
* no surrounding void to give words room for dispersing

words need to be packed up tightly together within a closed space

Saussure understands language as a system in which every words has its place, and, consequently, its meaning. System does not evolve, but remains in a state near equilibrium.

However, complex systems, like language, do not operate near equilibrium: relationships between components of system are non-lienar & dynamic

Signs in complex system always have an excess of meaning, with only some of the potential meaning realised in specific situations

#### Derrida's critique of Saussure

Derrida critiques 'metaphysics of presence', tendency in whole tradition of western philosophy

* Saussure insists that the *signified* is mental/psychological
* this implies that meaning of a sign is *present* to speaker when he uses it
* but this contradicts fact that meaning is constituted by a system of differences

### Networks and systems


## Ch. 5 Problems with representation

### Questions

How does a word in a language represent something? 

How do experts represent tehir knowledge?

Does a pattern contain certain explict features that can be represented in a pattern-recognition machine?

What is the relationship between the structure of the network and the phenomena that caused it?

How does a network represent the information of the domain it models?

Is it possible to analyze the structure of a successful network in order to determine how it solved the problem?

How do you use a priori knowledge ot predtermine the structure of a network, should such implementation 

## Ch. 6 Self-organization in complex systems

Chapter focus: how structure of complex systems:
* comes about
* develops
* changes

structure is the result of a complex interaction between:
* the environment
* the present state of the system 
* the history of the system

### Key aspects

#### Towards a sdefinition of self-organization

Working definition of self-organization:

*The capacity for self-organization is a property of complex systems which enables them to develop or change internal structuer spontaneously and adaptively in order to cope with, or manipulate, their environment.*

Examples: cell, brain, language, economic sytem of a country

Brain has ability to *learn*, thus necessaray changes in structure eanble brain to *remember* what has been learnt.

### Attributes of self-organizing systems

1. Structure is a result of interaction between system and its environment.
2. Internal structure of system can adapt dynamically to changes in the environment.
3. Self-organization is the result of higher-order, non-linear processes.
4. Self-organization is an emergent property of a system as a whole. Individual components only operate on local information & general principles.
5. Self-organizing systems increase in complexity.
6. Self-organization is impossible without some form of memory. A self-organising system therefore always has a history. This diachronic component cannot be ignored in any description of the system since previous conditions of the system form vital influences on present behavior.
7. The notion of function is intimately linked to our *descriptions* of complex systems. You can only really talk about the function of a system in the context of a larger system that it forms a part of.
8. The various 'levels' of the system cannot be given independent descriptions. The levels are in principle intertwined.


#### Basic principles of self-organization

1. System consists of *large* number of microscopic elements of units that are *relatively undifferentiated initially*.
2. Strengths of interconnections change as a result of *local information* only. These changes are often self-maintaining & cause system to move away from undifferentiated state.
3. There is *competition* among the units. Competing for limited resources is basic driving force behind the development of structure.
4. There is also *co-operation* among at least some units.
5. The interactions among unit have to be *non-linear*.
6. *symmetry-breaking*: if initial state is fully homogeneous, evolving structure could be too symmetrical.
7. *entrainment*: some patterns will catch others in their wake in the sense that they will start appearing in concert.
8. the memory of the system is stored in a distributed fashion.

### Self-organized criticality


the mechanism that leads to minor events is the same one that leads to major events.

the system organizes itself towards the critical point where single events have the widest possible range of effects. The system tunes itself towards optimum sensitivity to external inputs.

### Organisation through selection

To interepret its environment, system must have two attributes:
* some form of resistance to change
* mechanism for comparing different conditions in order to determine whether there has been enough change to warrant som eresponse

biological systems encounter constraints
* need to adapt to complex conditions
* must respond quickly enough

#### Learning through selection

Two ways system can respond to environment:
* instructive mechanism: environment imposes order directly on system structure
* selective (Darwinian) mechanism: increase in order rseults from interactionb etween system and environment

c.f. supervised vs unsupervised learning

#### Neural group selection

Brain self-organizes based on three principles

1. selective processes
2. interaction bewteen the system and ethe environment
3. loops & feedback

aspects of cortical map formation:
1. group confinement - neural groups have an optimum size, which is not known a priori
2. group selection - c.f. Hebb's rule
3. group competition -stability of groups determined by competitive interaction with other groups


#### The relationship between the brain and the world

Structure of the brain does not become a mirror of the environment, because:
1. effects are delayed
2. different impulses are always mixed as a result of the fact that the groups are embedded in a network.

Role of motor behavior: available info is also determined by the way in which the organism actively explores its environment.

Structure of the brain is strongly influenced by action.

Intelligence not an abstract process, it is embedded. Brains are part of our bodies.

Structures for communication remain embedded in a neural structure, and therefore will always be subjected to the complexities of network interaction.

### Philosophical implications of self-organization

#### Importance of relationships and patterns

Self-organization argues against:
* foundationalism (single origin, immutable principle)
* reductionism

postmodernism denies single meta-narratives, emphasizes difference & opposition

#### The role of history

No complex system, whether biological or social, can be understood without considering its history. 

History co-determines the structure of the system

history is not present in the system in such a way that it can be reconstructed.

global behavior of the system is the result of *patterns of traces*

#### Active and passive

self-organization is suspended between active & passive modes

reflexivity: self-organization is a self-transforming process; the system acts upon itself.

#### Stability and prediction

classical def'n of stability: small causes produce small effects

by this def'n, critically organized system is unstable

Poincare described instability probabilistically, chance events

In complex systems, it's not about randomness, but complex interaction of a large number of factors. Not about first-order logic, either.

'I find no alternative but to accept multiple, formally incmpatible descriptions as satisfactory explanation of many types of biological events.' - Pattee

It is the interaction of complex constraints that produces interesting behaviour — behaviour that cannot be described as chance events or instabilities.

A theory based on chance events, including those of quantum theory, 'serves only as an escape from classical determinism: it is not a theory of self-oranization" - Pattee

To be able to predict the behavior of a system is one of the classic crtieria
for a successful theory. We are working with systems, however, that cannot be
fully described by means of a classical theory.

Since the certainty with which the future can be predicted has been geatly
reuced, any plan of action ahs to be adapted continuously. If the plan is too
rigid — too much central control — the system will not be able to cope with unpredictable changes.

On the other hand, it will also be disastrous if the system tries to adjust itself to every superficial change, since such changes may easily be reversed witout notice. The system will waste its resources in trying to follow every fluctuation instead of adapting to higher-order trends.

Being able to discriminate between changes that should be followed and changes that should be resisted is vital to the survival of any organisation (or organism). This is achieved optimally when the control fo the system is not rigid and localizd, but distributed over the system, ensuring the positive dyanmics of self-organization is utilized effectively.

#### Ethics of self-organization

Values understood as emergent properties of social system

purely selfish behavior by members is deterimental not only to the system, but ultimately also to particular individuals


distributed, decentralized control makes system more flexible, therefore increases survability.

### Lorin's personal observations

Reminded of Woods's notions of:
* constraints
* finite resources
* reciprocity (ethics)
* adaptation (fixation vs vagabonding)


Starting with large number of relatively undifferentiated units: 

makes sense for human systems (e.g., organization starts as a startup, grows and specializes), but not for socio-technical, where it's more heterogeneous.

Hard to see how this applies to language

For the ethics aspect, where selfish behavior ultimately hurts the individual, that can take a while

Gets to distributed, but not to polycentric. Need some centraliztaion. 


## Ch. 7 Complexity and postmdoernism

### Postmodernism

Lyotard:

I will use the term *modern* to designate any science that legitimates
itself with reference to a metadiscoruse of this kind making explict appeal to
some grand narrative, such as the dialectics of the Spirit,  the hermeneutics of meaning, the emanticipation of the rational or workign subject, or the creation fo welath.

Postmodernism: incredulity towards meta-narratives

Must cope with multiplicity of discourses

Different institutions and diferent contexts produce different narratives which are not reducible to each other.

narrative understanding of knowledge

pluarity of smaller stories

refines our sensitivity to differences and reinforces our ability to tolerate the incommensurable

knowledge takes the form of narratives that are instrumental in allowing groups to achieve their goals and to make sense of what they are doing.

narratives are all local

cannot be linked together to form a grand narrative which unifies all knowledge

Postmodern ocndition: characterized by co-existence of  a multiplicity of heterogeneous discourses

Discussion of "anything goes" critique of postmdoernism
Local narratives only make sense in terms of their contrasts adn differences to surrounding narratives.

Meaning is generated through a dynamic process.

Discourses are in constant interaction, battling with each toher for territory, the provisional boundaries between them being the very stakes in the game.

This strategy of 'throwing away' \[falsification\] has the result of makign the body of knowledge qualifying as 'scientific' leaner and leaner. Eveyrthing too complex or containing uncertainties or unpredictability is, for the time being at least, left aside.

Discard consensus since it is impoverishing.

Dissenting voices receive no special privilege; they have to enter the 'agonistics of the network', where their relevance is dynamically determined through competition and co-operation in terms of the history as well as the changing needs and goals of the system.

Since all networks we have talked about are conteingent entities, they are finite.

Robustness and flexibility are two sides of the same coin. In terms of our social condition, this means that we would experience less postmodern stress by becoming less rigid in our interaction with each other and our environment.

### Complex systems and postmodern society

Implications of the ten characteristics of complex systems for contemporary culture. 

society can only survive as a *process*. It is defined not by its origins or goals, but by what it is doing. 

What postmodernism does reject is an interpretation of history which elevates it to a master key for unlocking the true meaning of present conditions.

Since we are in part creating society through our actions, no complete picture of its present state is avilable to anyone.

### Language as a complex system

Language is constantly transformed by the ways in which it is used.

Meaning is *local* phenomenon, valid in a certain frame of time and space.

Meaning is only generated when idnvidiaul words are cuaght in the play of the system.

Self organization describes how a complex system can develop and change its internal structure. The process id driven by competition for the resources of the system.

Information has a direct, non-determinate influence on the system: it *causes* certain changes in teh system, but it does not fully *determine* the nature of these changes.

Language interacts with the environment through the *users* of the language who have to interaact with the env't to survive and operate in it.

We try to makes sense of our experiences, and in the process create and expand our language.

Meaning flows from a complex process of interaction between information from the world, on the one hand, and a web of already existing relationships, built up through previous interactions, on the other hand.

### Understanding scientific knoweldge from a postmodern perspective

Lyotard's pragmatics of science:

1. Scientific knowledge requires that one language game — *denotation* — be retained and all others excluded.
2. Scientific knoweldge generated in this way is not part of the general 'social bond', but the property of the experts and professionals who organize themselves into exclusive institutes and institutions.
3. In the process of research, only the competence of the researcher is at stake.
4. Scientific statements do not increase their validty by being reported or through popularity.
5. Scientific knowledge is cumultative.

Lyotard's narrative knowledge:

1. The criteria for narrative knowledge are flexible and are dynamically defined by the society in which the narrative functions.
2. No specific linguistic form is privileged in these narratives.
3. In the 'transmission' of these narratives, sender, receive and the subjects discussed  are all considered in a way that strengthens the social bond.
4. Narratives have a strengate temporal nature. Their function is not primarily to *remember* the past, but to re-eanct past events as present events. The meaning of the narrative lies not in the fact that is is supported by some important piece of history, but in the metre and rhythm of its present telling.
5. No special procedure is necessary to 'authorise' the narrative process. The narrator is not isolated, but performs the function of integrator, and all those who participate can find themselves in any of the available roles (narrator, narratee, hero, etc.)

These two forms of knowledge - scientific and narrative, have been kept apart so long that they have become uncommensurable.

The world we live in is complex. This complexity is diverse but oragnized,
not chaotic. Descriptions of it cannot be reduced to simple coherent and
university valid sicourses. If we model complexity in terms of a network, any
given narrative will form a path, or trajectory, through the network. There
are a great diversity of such paths. The network is not only complex, but
also ydnamic. As we trace various narrative paths through it, it changes.
However, all paths rae constrained by the local structure of the network. In
some places these constraints can be fairly loose, in others they can be
quite tight. THe fact that there are many narrative paths to follow, even
between two specific points, does not imply that anything goes. All
nartatives are subject to some form of constraint, and some paths are ruled
out. All paths share the characteristics of contingency and provisionality.


### Lorin's comments

The concept of incredulity towards meta-narratives is appealing.

Political discourse implications are a bit scary.

Describes engineering as an "empirical science" (!)

Not sure I agree that robustness & flexibility are two sides of the same coin.
"The interactions have fairly short range" - this is an interesting issue in
the world of the internet, where the interaction is local in one sense, and
yet is very long distance in another sense. I think it's still true, but
"range" means something different here.

Number 3 of narrative knoweldge reminds me of triangle of storytelling: story, storyteller, audience
