# Dynamics in action

Alicia Juarrero

## Claims of book

1. an inadequate, 350-year-old model of cause and explanation underlies contemporary theories of action (p3)
2. theory of complex adaptive systems can serve as a metaphor that permits reconceptualizaiton of a cause, and in consequence a rethinking of action. (p5)
3. causal mechanism at work between levels of hierarchical organizaiton can best be understood as the operation of constraint (p6)

## Introduction

What is the difference between a wink and a blink? p1

### Aristotle

p2

#### Four causes

1. final - the goal/purpose toward which something aims
1. formal - that which makes anything that sort of thing and no other
1. material - the stuff out of which it is made
1. efficient - the force that brings things into being

#### No self cause

Claim: nothing can move, cause, or act on itself in the same respect.

Principle: nothing moves or changes itself (p3)

#### Types of reasoning

episteme - logic of reasoning proper to science

phronesis - practical wisdom

Because human behavior is temporally and contextually embedded, it is the central concern of pronsesis

### Modern philosophy

mechanistic view

efficient causality is the push-pull impact of external forces on inert matter

deduction from timeless adn contextless laws is the ideal of any legitimate form of reasoning

all cause is collision-like

explanatory ideal: deduction from determinstic laws

Modern philisophy's understanding of cause & explanation has failed as a general theory.

No reason to stick to this.

### Challenges to traditional view

- thermodynamics - temporal direction to physics
- living things are not closed, isolated, or near equilbrium

#### Darwin's theory of evolution

- accounted for increasing complexity & order despite second law
- environment in which organism is located gets a central role as the agent of selection

### Information theory

Thinking of actions as unbroken trajectories—calculated in terms of information flow, noise, and equivocation—allows us to avoid many of the traditional objections to which causal theories of action are vulnerables.

Action theory needs an account how of the content of an intention can inform and flow into behavior s.t. action actualizes the content of that intention.

Claim: conceptual framework of theory of complex adaptive systems can serve as theory-constiuttuive metaphor that permits reconceptualization of just such a case, and in consequence a rethiking of action.

### Key concepts of new scientific framework

1. complex adaptive systems are characterized by positive feedback processes in which product of process is necessary for process itself.
2. when parts interact to produce wholes, resulting distributed wholes in turn affect behavior of their parts, interlevel causality is at work.

complex dynamical wholes exert active power on their parts s.t. overall system is maintained and enhanced.

Undesrtanding dynamical systems can therefore revivle Aristole's concepts of formal and final cause by offering scientifically respectable model of how such cases cause.

### Constraints

Two types (Lila Gatlin)

- context-free - takes system's components far from equiprobability
- context-sensitive - synchronize and correlat previously independent parts into a systemic whole

examples of context-sensitive constraints:

- catalysts
- feedback loops
- biological resonance
- entrainment

From the bottom-up, establishment of context-sensitive constraints is the phase change that self-organizes the glboal level.

the self-org of the global level is the appearance of context-sensitive constraints on the system's components.

parts that were independent become correlated/interdependent due to context-sensitive constraints

even as they regulate alternatives, context-dependent constraints open up new possibilities

constraints work by modifying either:

- system's phase space
- probability distribution of events and movements within that space

Since actions are lower, motor-level implementations of higher-level intenational causes, reconceptualizing mental causation in terms of top-down, context-sensitive dynamical constraints can radically recast our thinking about action.

evidence suggests: human brain is a self-organized, complex adaptive system that encodes stimuli w/context-sensitive constraints

postulate: behavior constitues action when brain's self-organized dynamics originate, regulate, and constrain skeleto-muscular processes s.t. resulting behavior "satisfies the meaningful content" embodied in complex dynamics from which it issued.

Bottom-up, formulating a prior intention to wink would be the felt counterpart of a neurological phase change, the dynamical self-organization of a more complex level of coherent brain activity that integrates neuronal patterns embodying wants, desired, meaning, and the like.

By serving as brain's operator or order parameter, contextual constraints that embody an intention (acting top-down) would provide the behavior w/continuous, ongoing control & direction by modifying in real time the probability distribution of lower-level neurological processes and, as a consequence, the behavioral alternatives available to and implemented by the agent.

Time & context are as central to identity & behavior of these dynamic processes as they are to human beings.

Complex systems are essentially historical. 

If human beings and their behavior are complex adaptive phenomena, the precise pathway that their actions will take is simply unpredictable.

### hermeneutical interpretation / hermeneutics

* meaning of complete text is constructed from relationships among individual passages
* meaning of the story's individual passages is derived from meaning of the entire text in which those passagse are embedded
* continual, interpretive "tacking" from parts to whole adn back to parts
* reprodues the way dynamical systems self-organize out of the interrelationships among the parts—and then loop back to constrain those parts
* similarity to dynamics of self-organization makes hermeneutics uniquely suited as logic of explanation for stable states of self-organized sytems.

### phase change

at a phase change: system either reorganizes into higher level of complexity or falls apart

only way to explain a phase change is with a retrospective narrative that retraces the actual leap

geneaological narrative that makes references temporal and contextual events

narrative, interpretive, and historical explanations of action require expanded appreciation of what counta sas "reason" and "explanation"

they provide insight into and understanding of what actually happened

supply a rich descirption of the precise, detailed path that the agent took, including teh temporal and spatial dynamics in which agent was embedded and in which the action occurred

We understand her [character in the play "A Doll's House"] behavior by coming to appreciate all the complicated and messy factors that became entagled in her life; the drama shows how they interacted to produce a break.

also learn about:
* quirks & idiosyncracies of human psychology
* circumstances in which humans function
* how these contribute to unpredictability of our actions

Historical, interpretive stories might not allow us to predict future behavior, but they do allow us to understand why it is unpredictable.


## Ch. 1: How the Modern Understanding of Cause Came to Be

more generalized problem: failure of both philosophy and science to predict human behavior

philosophers lack satisfactory theory of:
* how causes cause
* how explanationas explain

All goes back to Aristotle

### Boat / cargo scenario

Example: boat threatened by oncoming storm. Captain throws cargo overboard to lighten load & prevent capsizing. Is this behavior voluntary, involuntary, or compulsory?

### Aristotle analysis

Aristotle: it depends on whether the "origin" or "principle of movement" is within the agent.

compulsory: cause is in the external circumstances and the agent contributes nothing (e.g. moving because I was pushed)

cargo example is "mixed" pace Aristotle

Voluntary actions are:
* purposive
* appropriate to the situation

Aristole distinguishes:
* acting by reason of ignorance
* someone who is drunk or in a rage

Only those acts brought about by a person's own efforts as a result of deliberation should be described as "chosen".

### Aristotle's views on changes & potencies
all becoming involves transformation of something that is so only "potentially" into something that is "actually" so

potencies: originative sources of change in another thing or in the thing itself *qua* other

two kinds:
* passive - to be acted upon (a potenticy to receive change that is "Contained in matter)
* active - to act on (a potentcy foudn in agents to impart change)

Since nothing can simultaenously possess both potencies wrt same property, nothing can act on itself.

### Aristotle's views on animal/human motion

movement: 
* part moves and part is moved 
* does not move as a whole
* is not moved as a whole

*orexis* – psyche or soul's one-way reaching out toward an object in the external world perceived by the animal or human as significant

orexis as unmoved mover

soul (active aspect) of lion causes body (passive aspect) to move


explains animal self-motion by splitting organism in two: soul (unmoved mover) body (moved)

Lion's pursuit of gazelle: voluntary self-motion


blinks: efficiently caused by something external to agent's soul (compulsory behavior)

Gazelle is not the final cause (goal) for the lion, lion must perceive the gazelle as food for it to be object of lion's desire.

awareness and goal-directedness are hinges connecting the inside and outside

* with this split, Aristotle embeds organism in the environment
* organism's internal state is dependent on something outside it


Aristotle's concept of "voluntary" suggest sense of "free" that means in part "routed through agent's soul"

### Reflexivity

Self cause is example of puzzle of reflexivity

Probem is circumvented by maintaining that nothing deceives, contradicts, or efficiently causes itself (no strange loops!)

### Mechanistic causes of Newtonian science

By early 17th C, modern science insisted that:
* organic wholes reduce to their component parts
* only efficient causes (forces) are properly causal

wholes are epiphenominal (causally impotent by-products)

deterministic universe of universal laws + fully specifiable initial conditions = perfect prediction (Laplace's demon!)

context contributes nothing to reality

object's only real properties were its *primary* properties, which are internal to object (e.g., mass)

Newtonian physics: time-reversible

time-reversibility means that final cause is an illusion

### Modern philosophy

Descartes's dualism: nonphysical mind activates the body as efficient cause

mind does not require anything external to activate it, not even final cause

causes must be external to their effects
