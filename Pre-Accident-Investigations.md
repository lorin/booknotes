## Core context information list

These must be present to tell the story of the failure

### I must have an explanation of the failure

Need an explanation of how the event happened.

### I need to understand how the energy of the failure was or was not isolated from the worker or workers involved in the failure

* What went wrong?
* What went right?
* Where did the failure start?
* When did our systems kick in to mitigate further failure (if it all)?

### I need an understanding of how some type of defense or defenses built into the organization were either not present, or if present for some reason failed

Every failure that takes place happens because some defense either did not work or was not present in the work environment.


### I must be ever vigilant in remembering, "size does not matter"

The consequence of a failure does not determine the importance of the failure.

“What is the difference between a big event and a small event?” The answer, and I think I have heard them all, really should always be, “nothing.” All events allow us the opportunity to learn.

Small events, those events with small consequences, are often much richer in context and story than what our organizations define as large events.


### I must always remember that bad things don't always happen to bad people

Not thinking people involved in an event are bad is difficult.

It will take deliberate attempts on your part to not label the workers involved
as something less than perfect.


## Questions about your org
* How do your workers define safety and performance success?
* How do your managers define safety and performance success?
* Are they the same definition?


## Nine things managers should ask first and in order when theya re notified that something unexpected happened

1. Your response to an event matters!
2. Are the people OK?
3. Is the facility safe, secure, and stable?
4. Tell me the *story* of what happened?
5. What could have happened?
6. What factors led up to this event?
7. What worked well? What did not work?
8. Where else could this happen?
9. What else do I need to know about this event?


## Pre-accident investigation process steps

1. Look for high consequence activities
2. Look for small signals that can indicate system weaknesses or problems within the normal work process
3. Look for error provoking systems steps and processes
4. Look for error likely conditions
5. Listen to your workers
6. Ask yousrelf what keeps you up at night?



## Companies that manage safety performance well constantly work on these four things

1. We are fixated on where the next failure will happen
2. We constantly strive to reduce complicated operations
3. We respond to low level signals seriously
4. We respond to events deliberately


## Reasons you must have a cause for every ecent

1. Not knowing what caused an accident is downright scary
1. Headquarters, management, or the regular require a cause statement.
3. We have a need to punish the guilty.
4. We must develop corrective actions.
5. We want to know how to adjust our organization's systems and behaviors to avoid the same kind of trouble happening again.

## Four successul wrap up post-job questions

1. What happened the way you thought it would happen?
2. What surprised you?
3. What hazards did we identify and what hazards did we miss?
4. Where did you have to "make do,"  improvise or adapt?


## Questions to ask about organization

* What type of managers am I dealing with in my org?
* What individual strategies have I set up so these mangers can be successful?
* What success stories can I tell this team to keep them both motivated for this change and encouraged that this change is having the desired effect?
* Have I assumed a level of knowledge and skill in safety leadership that is not there yet?
* Am I accessing reality? Am I working with the management team? Is it the case that I don't have the management team I wish I had?



## Selected quotes

Error is simply the unintentional deviation from an unexpected behavior.

Workers (and drivers) are at their best when they are allowed to detect and correct their performance in normal systems.

First, failure happens because the worker believes that what is aobut to happen to them is simply not possible.

Workers do the same thing at work. It worked last time. It worked the last 10,000 times. Normally, it always work OK. Why would it not work the next time?

Secondly, failure happens because failure often has nothing to do with the tasks and processes the worker is currently doing in the field. ... things are
connected, but they are usually connected post-failure and in such a way that the connection becomes obvious and simple—after you see the connection.

(Above comment is made in the context of multitasking and sharing attention).

Thirdly, failure happens when the worker feels the possibility of getting the intended outcome is well worth whatever risk is present in the work environment.

I use the word surprise in my write-ups of events.

Most of the stories I tell in my work are stories about the way the organization failed the worker, and almost never about how the worker failed the organization.

Sometimes big, horrific events are actually quite simple, straightforward failures. A bolt snaps,
scaffoldings fall, and the consequences are terrible.

The other side of that coin is that sometimes tiny events have profound learning implications for the organization. A small event happens, and you
suddenly realize your entire system is flawed and must be immediatley strengthened.

Event size is not nearly as powerful as event learning.

Don't let the drama of an event (or lack of drama of an event) dictate how much or how deeply you respond.


(About the Titanic).

What Star leadership made a relatively normal last minute change in the
equipment officer. The old equipment officer forgetfully took the key to the
equipment sotrage locker with im when he transferred from the ship. Titanic's
new equipment officer couldn't find a replacement key, and because there was no
access to the equipment storage area, the lookouts were not issued with any
binoculars.

Your biggest challenge is to create an organization that is not afraid to talk to each other about safety.

Errors, near misses, good catches, close calls—any of these factors could indicate there is a problem, without the actual consequences of the failure. Safety professionals look on indicators of this type as 'gifts.'

You must monitor low level events in order to understand where your systems are
confusing, conflicting, or potentially flawed.

What these small events do is to allow an organization to "pulse" its processes
and systems to identify potential larger system weaknesses or failures. The
premise is that these low signal indicators are in relity pointers towards
larger system weaknesses and failures.

Many of our systems are set up to be effective accounting systems, and not good work management systems. These systems are rife with potential failures.

What your job becomes is to identify places within your organization where the
organization sets up workers to fail.

Look for conditions that lead to failure, not trends or numeric patterns, and when you find these conditions, learn from them.

It all boils down to how your organization, your managers, your teams, and you learn from your organization’s normal, routine work—day in and day out.

workers don't cause failure; what workers do is trigger a whole lot of weaknesses that exist in environments, proceesses, systems, job sites, and in the work or organization itself. These weaknesses are not new or unusual. These weaknesses are always present in your organization.

Culturally, we have become trapped by the idea that everything must have a cause.

Organizations need cause. They must have something or someone to blame for such
a stupid act.

We must do something as soon as possible to bring our systems back in order.

One of the strongest drivers to find the bad woker and identify a root cause is the fact that it is much easier and cheaper to fix *one* worker and fix *one* cause than it is to look at an entire set of processes and relationships that exist throughout an entire organization.

In many ways we construct cause in order to make our need for the creation of improvement actions quick, simple, and sustainable.

More importantly, there is no relationship between error and effects. Error just happens; it either does or does not have an effect. Cause, according to the rules of logic, always creates effect. Error is not a cause, nor it is an effect. Error is simply error—an unintentional deviation from an expected behavior or outcome (DFEO).

The problem with all this operational "play" in the work our workers do is the lack of knowledge your organization has about the work environment. As workers adapt and improvise solutions to "discovered work," new dangers are also discovered. In the environment of discovery, our workers are now dealing with hazards that we have not planned for, mitigated for, protected for.

The bets way to discover this information is to ask for it. You can do post-job
reviews of successful work. Indeed, you *should* do post-job reviews of
successful work.

The more you know about how work happens, the better prepared you will be to help workers create safety in practice.

The idea that by identifying the things that the worker should have done in order to avoid this accident the organization would be able to either change history or prevent the next event is foolish, but extremely attractive when answering the question, "why did this happen?"

You will never know how much good you are doing for your organization. Just know that you are doing the best work you have ever done.

The biggest enemy of safety is dogma – the belief that we already know the answers to the questions our organizations are forced to ask.

The secret is that all new knowledge demands building (or finding) a bridge to
older knowledge in order to make the change.

Read everything you can find on systems performance, error theory, complex
adaptive systems, and Human Performance.

You are most certainly changing things, but thse changes come from wisdom and
building on the past. It is evolving. You are not throwing everything away. You
are building on the past only to make it safer, communicate better, and create
greater production. You are helping your organization evolve.

Everything you do to increase your organization's ability to learn makes your organization safer.

the most important and in many ways the easiest change you can make is to change your management team's reaction to failure.

You can't measure things that don't happen, but you can talk about changes in
attitudes, communication, and early problem identification, and excellent
catches that are happening in the field.

Probably the best advice that can be given when engaging management in the many
discussions around changing the way they respond to Human Performance issues in
your organization is to build relationshps through conversations—not through
browbeating and lecturing. Change happens through dialogue. A Human Performance
program is a change in the way your organization manages safety. Move your
managers by talking to them about what is admirable in the way they manage
safety, and where there is potential to develop a new way to see work and
workers.

Remember: failures tend to be unexpected combinations of normal performance variability.

It is also worth reminding each other that the parts of an event are not as interesting as the relationship between those parts.

Remmeber our discussion about work as imagined or planned, and work as actually
done? The space between the organization's idea of work and the workers' idea
of work is where learning about safety happens. 

Finding the space for learning helps, but within that space is a way to
prioritize individual tasks and activities, based upon risk and potential
outcomes.

The most significant safety management tip in the world is pretty straightforward: never place a worker only one defense away from a failure.

The workers can tell you where the process is especially strong, and where the process depends more on the worker to create safety than on the processes and systems.

We are emotionally wired to blame ourselves for mistakes that, in retrospect, seem stupid.

I can almost guarntee you will overshoot your audience at one point or another
in your training program.
