# The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt

## Overview

This book is a descriptive account of the human sense of morality,
what aspects of morality are universal and what differs across cultures,
and how morality helps societies function.

Classification: scientific book (pyschology)

## Parts

It's written in three parts.

The first part is about how human moral judgments are intuitionist. We
rationalize after the fact, rather than making decisions based on rationality.
Our intuition is the "elephant" and rationality is the "rider". 

The second part is about how there are six aspects of morality:

1. care/harm
1. fairness/cheating
1. loyalty/betrayal
1. authority/subversion
1. sanctity/degradation
1. liberty/oppression

Liberals (WEIRD) generally only care about care, fairness, and liberty, where
conservatives care about all six.

Non-WEIRD cultures, and the poor, tend more towards all six rather than just
three.

The third part is about how human morality has a positive benefit for groups in
terms of natural selection: groups with morality will cooperate more
effectively.

            * E.O. Wilson sided with Hume
        - The emotional nenties
        - Why atheists won't sell their souls
        - "Seeing-that" versus "reasoning-why"
        - The rider and the elephant
        - How to win an argument
        - In sum
            * Mind is divided into parts, like a rider (controlled process) on
              an elephant (automatic processes). The rider evolved to serve the
              elephant.
            * You can see the rider serving the elephant when people are
              morally dumbfounded. They have strong gut feelings about what is
              right and wrong, and they struggle to construct post hoc
              justifications for those feelings. Even when the servant
              (reasoning) comes back empty-handed, the master (intuition)
              doesn't change his judgment.
            * The social intuionist model starts with Hume's model and makes
              it moral social. Moral rasoning is part of our lifelong struggle
              to win friends and influence people. That's why I say that
              "intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second." You'll
              misunderstand moral reasoning if you think about it as something
              people do by themselves in order to figure out the truth.
            * Therefore, if you want to change someone's mind about a moral or
              political issue, *talk to the elephant first*. If you ask people
              to believe something that violates their intuitions, they will
              devote their efforts to finding an escape hatch-a reason to doubt
              your argument or conclusion. They will almost always succeed.
    3. Elephants rule
        - 1. Brains evaluate instantly and constantly
        - 2. Social and political judgments are particularly intuitive
        - 3. Our bodies guide our judgments
        - 4. Psychopaths reason but don't feel
        - 5. Babies feel but don't reason
        - 6. Affective reactions are in the right place at the right time in the
           brain
        - Elephants are sometimes open to reason
            * Main way we change mind on moral issues is interacting with other people
            * If there is affection, admiration, or desire to pleaes other
              person, elephant leans *toward* that person and rider tries to
              find truth in other person's argument
        - In sum
            * when we see or hear about the things other people do, the elephant begins to lean immediately.
            * The rider, who is always trying to anticipate the elephant’s next move, begins looking around for a way to support such a move.
    4. Vote for me (here's why)
        - No subtitle
            * Glaucon (Plato's brother) proposed thought experiment
            * ring of Gyges: makes wearer invisible
            * Glaucon's claim: wearer would act imorally
            * Conclusion: people only want to appear moral rather than be moral
            * Glaucon asks Socrates: prove that it's better to be just man who
              is seen as unjust than an unjust man who is seen as just
            * Glaucon was right:
                - People care more about appearance & reputation than reality
                - To design ethical society, make sure that everyone's reputation is on the line all the time
        - We are all intuitive politicians
            * Tetlock: A central function of thought is making sure that one acts in ways that can be persuasively justified or excused to others.
        - We are all intuitive politicians
        - 1. We are obsessed with polls
        - 2. Our in-house press secretary automatically justifies everything
        - 3. We lie, cheat, and justify so well that we honestly believe we are
             honest
        - 4. Reasoning (and Google) can take you wherever you want to go
        - 5. We can believe almost anything that supports our team
        - The rationalist delusion
            * Nobody is ever going to invent an ethics class that makes people behave ethically after they step out of the classroom.
        - In sum
            * We are obsessively concerned about what others think of us, although much of the concern is unconscious and invisible to us.
            * Conscious reasoning functions like a press secretary who automatically justifies any position taken by the president.
            * With the help of our press secretary, we are able to lie and cheat often, and then cover it up so effectively that we convince even ourselves.
            * Reasoning can take us to almost any conclusion we want to reach, because we ask “Can I believe it?” when we want to believe something, but “Must I believe it?” when we don’t want to believe. The answer is almost always yes to the first question and no to the second.
            * In moral and political matters we are often groupish, rather than selfish. We deploy our reasoning skills to support our team, and to demonstrate commitment to our team.
* Part II: There's more to morality than harm and fairness
    5. Beyond weird morality
        - Three ethics are more descriptive than one
        - How I became a pluralist
        - Stepping out of the matrix

    6. Taste buds of the righteous mind
    7. The moral foundations of politics
    8. The conservative advantage
* Part III: Morality Binds and Blinds
    9. Why are we so groupish?
    10. The hive switch
    11. Religion is a team sport
    12. Can't we all disagree more constructively
* Conclusion

## Raw notes

Humans are intuitionists, our moral judgments are based on rational analysis.

First draft: we are predisposed towards certain moral beliefs, but these are
shaped by our experiences. This means that morality is neither innate
(nativist) nor is it entirely learned (empiricist). But it's also not the case
that kids construct their morality entirely from interactions (rationalist,
Piaget, Kohlberg)

There is more to morality than harm and fairness.
