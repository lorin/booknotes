# The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt

See also <http://www.moralfoundations.org/>

## Overview

This book is a descriptive account of the intuitive nature of human morality,
what aspects of morality are universal and what differs across cultures,
and how morality helps societies function.

Classification: scientific book (pyschology)

Problem the author is trying to solve: what is the nature of human morality,
how did it evolve, and what advantages does it provide, from an evolutionary
design perspective?

## Parts

It's written in three parts.

The first part is about how human moral judgments are intuitionist. We
rationalize after the fact, rather than making decisions based on rationality.
Our intuition is the "elephant" and rationality is the "rider". 

The second part is about how there are six aspects of morality:

1. care/harm - care for children
1. fairness/cheating - defense against free riders
1. loyalty/betrayal - help form & maintain coalitions
1. authority/subversion - help form relationships that benefit us in social hierarchies
1. sanctity/degradation - omnivore's dilemma: protection against pathogens &
   parasites
1. liberty/oppression - defense against alphas: individuals who would dominate small
   group

Liberals (WEIRD) generally only care about care, fairness, and liberty, where
conservatives care about all six.

Non-WEIRD cultures, and the poor, tend more towards all six rather than just
three.

The third part is about how human morality has a positive benefit for groups in
terms of natural selection: groups with morality will cooperate more
effectively.

            * empriricism vs rationalism
            * Piaget, self-constructed kids figure it out for themselves
            * Lawrence Kohlberg studied children
        - The liberal consensus
            * Kohlberg's influence
        - An easier test

        - Inventing victims
        - In sum
    2. The intuitive dog and its rational tail
        - No subtitle
            * Plato: reason ought to be the master
            * Hume: reason is and ought to be the servant of the passions
            * Jefferson: reason and sentiment are independent co-rulers
        - Wilson's prophecy
            * E.O. Wilson sided with Hume
        - The emotional nenties
        - Why atheists won't sell their souls
        - "Seeing-that" versus "reasoning-why"
        - The rider and the elephant
        - How to win an argument
        - In sum
            * Mind is divided into parts, like a rider (controlled process) on
              an elephant (automatic processes). The rider evolved to serve the
              elephant.
            * You can see the rider serving the elephant when people are
              morally dumbfounded. They have strong gut feelings about what is
              right and wrong, and they struggle to construct post hoc
              justifications for those feelings. Even when the servant
              (reasoning) comes back empty-handed, the master (intuition)
              doesn't change his judgment.
            * The social intuionist model starts with Hume's model and makes
              it moral social. Moral rasoning is part of our lifelong struggle
              to win friends and influence people. That's why I say that
              "intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second." You'll
              misunderstand moral reasoning if you think about it as something
              people do by themselves in order to figure out the truth.
            * Therefore, if you want to change someone's mind about a moral or
              political issue, *talk to the elephant first*. If you ask people
              to believe something that violates their intuitions, they will
              devote their efforts to finding an escape hatch-a reason to doubt
              your argument or conclusion. They will almost always succeed.
    3. Elephants rule
        - 1. Brains evaluate instantly and constantly
        - 2. Social and political judgments are particularly intuitive
        - 3. Our bodies guide our judgments
        - 4. Psychopaths reason but don't feel
        - 5. Babies feel but don't reason
        - 6. Affective reactions are in the right place at the right time in the
           brain
        - Elephants are sometimes open to reason
            * Main way we change mind on moral issues is interacting with other people
            * If there is affection, admiration, or desire to pleaes other
              person, elephant leans *toward* that person and rider tries to
              find truth in other person's argument
        - In sum
            * when we see or hear about the things other people do, the elephant begins to lean immediately.
            * The rider, who is always trying to anticipate the elephant’s next move, begins looking around for a way to support such a move.
    4. Vote for me (here's why)
        - No subtitle
            * Glaucon (Plato's brother) proposed thought experiment
            * ring of Gyges: makes wearer invisible
            * Glaucon's claim: wearer would act imorally
            * Conclusion: people only want to appear moral rather than be moral
            * Glaucon asks Socrates: prove that it's better to be just man who
              is seen as unjust than an unjust man who is seen as just
            * Glaucon was right:
                - People care more about appearance & reputation than reality
                - To design ethical society, make sure that everyone's reputation is on the line all the time
        - We are all intuitive politicians
            * Tetlock: A central function of thought is making sure that one acts in ways that can be persuasively justified or excused to others.
        - We are all intuitive politicians
        - 1. We are obsessed with polls
        - 2. Our in-house press secretary automatically justifies everything
        - 3. We lie, cheat, and justify so well that we honestly believe we are
             honest
        - 4. Reasoning (and Google) can take you wherever you want to go
        - 5. We can believe almost anything that supports our team
        - The rationalist delusion
            * Nobody is ever going to invent an ethics class that makes people behave ethically after they step out of the classroom.
        - In sum
            * We are obsessively concerned about what others think of us, although much of the concern is unconscious and invisible to us.
            * Conscious reasoning functions like a press secretary who automatically justifies any position taken by the president.
            * With the help of our press secretary, we are able to lie and cheat often, and then cover it up so effectively that we convince even ourselves.
            * Reasoning can take us to almost any conclusion we want to reach, because we ask “Can I believe it?” when we want to believe something, but “Must I believe it?” when we don’t want to believe. The answer is almost always yes to the first question and no to the second.
            * In moral and political matters we are often groupish, rather than selfish. We deploy our reasoning skills to support our team, and to demonstrate commitment to our team.
* Part II: There's more to morality than harm and fairness
    5. Beyond weird morality
        - Three ethics are more descriptive than one
        - How I became a pluralist
        - Stepping out of the matrix
        - In sum
            * The WEIRDer you are, the more you perceive a world full of separate objects, rather than relationships.
            * Moral pluralism is true descriptively. As a simple matter of anthropological fact, the moral domain varies across cultures.
            * The moral domain is unusually narrow in WEIRD cultures, where it is largely limited to the ethic of autonomy (i.e., moral concerns about individuals harming, oppressing, or cheating other individuals). It is broader—including the ethics of community and divinity—in most other societies, and within religious and conservative moral matrices within WEIRD societies.
            * Moral matrices bind people together and blind them to the coherence, or even existence, of other matrices. This makes it very difficult for people to consider the possibility that there might really be more than one form of moral truth, or more than one valid framework for judging people or running a society.

    6. Taste buds of the righteous mind
        * The birth of moral science
        * Attack of the systemizers
            - Simon Baron-Cohen: there are two spectra related to autism (cognitive style)
                * empathizing: the drive to identify another person’s emotions and thoughts, and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion.
                * systemizing: the drive to analyse the variables in a system, to derive the underlying rules that govern the behaviour of the system.
            - Kant & Bentham were low empathsizers & high systemizers
        * Benthan and the utilitarian grill
        * Kant and the deontological diner
        * Getting back on track
        * Broadening the palate
        * Moral foundations theory
            - Modules are like little switches in the brains of all mammals
            - They are switched on by patterns that were important for survival
              in a particular ecological niche
            - Example: reacting with fear when seeing a snake (snake detector)
            - original triggers (real snakes) vs current triggers (real snokes,
              toy snakes, curved sticks, thick ropes, etc.)
        * In sum
            - Morality is like taste in many ways—an analogy made long ago by Hume and Mencius.
            - Deontology and utilitarianism are “one-receptor” moralities that are likely to appeal most strongly to people who are high on systemizing and low on empathizing.
            - Hume’s pluralist, sentimentalist, and naturalist approach to ethics is more promising than utilitarianism or deontology for modern moral psychology. As a first step in resuming Hume’s project, we should try to identify the taste receptors of the righteous mind.
            - Modularity can help us think about innate receptors, and how they produce a variety of initial perceptions that get developed in culturally variable ways.
            - Five good candidates for being taste receptors of the righteous mind are care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity.
    7. The moral foundations of politics
        - A note on innateness
            * Metaphor: First draft is written by genes during fetal development
            * Not unmalleable, but organized in advance of experience
        - 1. The care/harm foundation
        - 2. The fairness/cheating foundation
            * Robert Trivers: reciprocal altruism
            * Proportionality
        - 3. The loyalty/betrayal foundation
        - 4. The authority/subversion foundation
        - 5. The sanctity/degradation foundation
        - In sum
            * The Care/harm foundation evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of caring for vulnerable children. It makes us sensitive to signs of suffering and need; it makes us despise cruelty and want to care for those who are suffering.
            * The Fairness/cheating foundation evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of reaping the rewards of cooperation without getting exploited. It makes us sensitive to indications that another person is likely to be a good (or bad) partner for collaboration and reciprocal altruism. It makes us want to shun or punish cheaters.
            * The Loyalty/betrayal foundation evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of forming and maintaining coalitions. It makes us sensitive to signs that another person is (or is not) a team player. It makes us trust and reward such people, and it makes us want to hurt, ostracize, or even kill those who betray us or our group.
            * The Authority/subversion foundation evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of forging relationships that will benefit us within social hierarchies. It makes us sensitive to signs of rank or status, and to signs that other people are (or are not) behaving properly, given their position.
            * The Sanctity/degradation foundation evolved initially in response to the adaptive challenge of the omnivore’s dilemma, and then to the broader challenge of living in a world of pathogens and parasites. It includes the behavioral immune system, which can make us wary of a diverse array of symbolic objects and threats. It makes it possible for people to invest objects with irrational and extreme values—both positive and negative—which are important for binding groups together.
    8. The conservative advantage
        - Measuring morals
        - What makes people vote Republican
            * Vision of society: John Stuart Mill vs. Emile Durkheim
            * Mill
                - individualistic
                - social contract for mutual benefit
                - prevent harm to others
                - exclusively based on care & fairness
            * Durkheim
                - over time, people found ways of living together
                - binding themselves to each other
                - suppressing each other's selfishness
                - punishing deviants & free riders who threaten group
                - Basic social unit: hierarchical structural family
                - danger: anomie (normlessness)
                - Stable network of nested & overlapping groups
                - groups socialize, reshape and care for individuals
                - if left to own devices, individuals would pursue shallow,
                - carnal, selfish pleasures
                - self-control over self-expressoin
                - duty over rights
                - loyalty to one's groups over concern for out-groups
            * Durkheimian society requires loyalty, authority & sanctity
              foundations
        - What I had missed
        - The liberty/opression foundation
            * self-domestication: humans becamse tamer over time, which helped them cooperate better
            * The Liberty/oppression foundation, I propose, evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of living in small groups with individuals who would, if given the chance, dominate, bully, and constrain others. The original triggers therefore include signs of attempted domination.
        - Fairness as proportionality
            * Recpirocal altruism is not easy to find among nonhuman species
            * Reciprocal altruism fails to explain why people cooperate in
              group activities
            * Egalitarianism more rooted in hatred of domination than love of
              equality
            * protect group from cheaters & free riders
        - Three versus six
        - In sum
            * Republicans understand social intuitionist model better than
              Democrats
            * Republicans speak more directly to the elephant
            * Republicans have a better grasp of Moral Foundations Theory
            * Durkheimian view of society
                - Basic social unit: family, not individaul
                - Order, hierarchy & tradition are valued
* Part III: Morality Binds and Blinds
    9. Why are we so groupish?
        - Victorious tribes?
            * Multilevel selection
        - A fast herd of deer?
            * group selection
        - Exhibit A: major transitions in evolution
            * ultraoscial: live in v. large groups that have some internal
              structure, enabling them to reap benefits of division of labor
            * All non-human ultra-socials need to defned a shared nest
        - Exhibit B: shared intentionality
            * Chimps can't collaborate
            * human cognition veered away from that of other primates when our ancestors developed shared intentionality
        - Exhibit C: genes & cultures coevolve
            * Major events in human evolution:
                - 5-7 MYA: ancestors of humans diverge from ancestors of
                  chimps/bonobos
                - 4 MYA: Australopithecines (e.g., "Lucy") emerge
                - 2.4 MYA: Genus Homo emerges, Oldowan tool kit
                - 1.8 MYA: Acheulean tool kit appears
                - 500-700 KYA: Shared intentionality enables cumulative culture
                  & gene-culture coevolution in Homo heilbergensis. Hunting
                  with spears, plus cooking on hearths, shows much more
                  collaboraitve groups
                - 50-70 KYA: modern humans migrate out of Africa & Middle East
                - 2-7 KYA: Holocene begins; agriculture & herding. Gene-culture
                  coevolution speeds up, City-states, empires
         - Exhibit D: evolution can be fast
         - It's not all about war
         - In sum
            * Major transitions produce superorganisms
            * Shared intentionality generates moral matrices
            * Genes & cultures coevolve
            * Evolution can be fast
    10. The hive switch
        - No subtitle
            * muscular bonding: moving together in time (e.g. synchronized
              drilling) shuts down self & creates temporary super-organism
            * enables people to function as a unit
            * Men in battle risk their lives for comrades-in-arms, not country
              or ideals
        - The hive hypothesis
            * Hypothesis: human beings are conditional hive creatures
        - Collective emotions
            * Barbara Ehrenreich: Dancing in the streets: a history of
              collective joy
            * ecastic dancing
            * Homo duplex: 
        - So many ways to flip the switch
            1. Awe in nature
            2. Durkheimogens
                * Drugs
            3. Raves
        - The biology of the hive switch
            * oxytocin
            * mirror neurons
        - Hives at work
            * In order to foster hive switch
                - Increase similarity, not diversity
                - Exploit synchrony
                - Create healthy competition among teams, not individuals
        - Political hives
        - In sum
    11. Religion is a team sport
        - The lone believer
        - The new athiest story: by-products, then parasites
            * hypersensitive agency detection advice
        - A better story: by-products, then cultural
        - group selection
        - The Durkheimian story: by-products, then maypoles
        - Is God a force for good or evil?
        - Chimps and bees and Gods
        - The definition of morality (at last)
            * Moral systems: interlocking sets of values, virtues, norms, practices, identities, institutions, technologies, and evolved psychological mechanisms that work together to suppress or regulate self-interest and make cooperative societies possible.
            * above is a functionalist definition
        - In sum
            * Durkheimian approach to religion focuses on belonging
            * Darwinian approach to morality involves multilevel selection
            * Religious practices bound our ancestors into groups
            * Blinding: once something is sacred, devotees can no longer
              question it or think clearly about it
    12. Can't we all disagree more constructively
        - A note about political diversity
        - From genes to moral matrices
        - Step 1: genes make brains
        - Step 2: traits guide children along different paths
        - Step 3: people construct life narratives
        - The grand narratives of liberalism and conservatism
            * Liberal progress narrative
            * Conservative heroism narrative of defense
        - The left's blind spot: moral capital
        - A yin and two yangs
        - Yin: liberal wisdom
            * Liberal moral matrix
                - Most sacred value: care for victims of oppression 
                - high care, medium high liberty, medium
              fairness, low loyalty, authority, sanctitiy
            * Point #1: governments can and should restrain corporate
              superorganisms
            * Point #2: some problems really can be solved by regulation
        - Yang #1: libertarian wisdom
            * Libertarian moral matrix
                - Most sacred value: individual liberty
                - High liberty, medium fairness, low care, loyalty, authority, sanctity
            * Counterpoint #1: markets are miraculous
        - Yang #2: social conservative wisdom
            * social conservative moral matrix
                - Most sacred value: preserve the instuttions and traditions
                  that sustain a moral community
                - Medium care, medium liberty, medium fairness, medium loyalty,
                  medium authority, medium sanctity

## Miscellaneous notes

Humans are intuitionists, our moral judgments are based on rational analysis.

First draft: we are predisposed towards certain moral beliefs, but these are
shaped by our experiences. This means that morality is neither innate
(nativist) nor is it entirely learned (empiricist). But it's also not the case
that kids construct their morality entirely from interactions (rationalist,
Piaget, Kohlberg)

There is more to morality than harm and fairness.

The Rubicon crossing that let our ancestors function so well in their groups
was the emergence of the uniquely human ability to share intentions and other
mental representations.

Hive hypothesis: human beings are conditional hive creatures: under special
conditions, can transcend self-interest and lose ourselves in something larger
than ourselves.

Homo duplex: a creature who exists at two levels: as an individual and as part
of the larger society.

Liberal narrative:

> Once upon a time, the vast majority of human persons suffered in societies and social institutions that were unjust, unhealthy, repressive, and oppressive. These traditional societies were reprehensible because of their deep-rooted inequality, exploitation, and irrational traditionalism.… But the noble human aspiration for autonomy, equality, and prosperity struggled mightily against the forces of misery and oppression, and eventually succeeded in establishing modern, liberal, democratic, capitalist, welfare societies. While modern social conditions hold the potential to maximize the individual freedom and pleasure of all, there is much work to be done to dismantle the powerful vestiges of inequality, exploitation, and repression. This struggle for the good society in which individuals are equal and free to pursue their self-defined happiness is the one mission truly worth dedicating one’s life to achieving.

Conservative narrative:

> Once upon a time, America was a shining beacon. Then liberals came along and erected an enormous federal bureaucracy that handcuffed the invisible hand of the free market. They subverted our traditional American values and opposed God and faith at every step of the way.… Instead of requiring that people work for a living, they siphoned money from hardworking Americans and gave it to Cadillac-driving drug addicts and welfare queens. Instead of punishing criminals, they tried to “understand” them. Instead of worrying about the victims of crime, they worried about the rights of criminals.… Instead of adhering to traditional American values of family, fidelity, and personal responsibility, they preached promiscuity, premarital sex, and the gay lifestyle … and they encouraged a feminist agenda that undermined traditional family roles.… Instead of projecting strength to those who would do evil around the world, they cut military budgets, disrespected our soldiers in uniform, burned our flag, and chose negotiation and multilateralism.… Then Americans decided to take their country back from those who sought to undermine it.




## Review

Haidt is one of the rare social scientists who writes well, which makes reading
this book a treat.

Weaves a narrative from his own primary research, development psychology,
evolutionary psychology, anthropology, sociology, and philosophy.
