# Introduction to General Systems Thinking

Book by Gerald M. Weinberg

This is a practical book. It's kind of a problem-solving book, but it's more of a how-to-look-at-problems book rather than specifically how to solve problems.

## Keywords
law, system, functional notation, observer, observations, interpretation, state, set, categorization, properties, black-box, white box, structure, behavior

## secondary keywords
* boundary, port, membrane
* symmetry, composition, transitivity
* diachronic, synchronic
* dimensional reduction
* open systems vs closed system
* connections, partitions

- software-influenced: state-oriented. Also, sets. "black box" vs "white box"

## Laws and principles

### The Square Law of Computation
- unless some simplifications can be made, the amount of computation involved increases at least as fast as the square of the number of equations

### The Law of Medium Numbers
- for medium number systems, we can expect that large fluctuations, irregularities, and discrepancy with any theory will occur more or less regularly

### The Main Article of General Systems Faith (Boulding)
- the order of the empirical world itself has an order which might be called order of the second degree

### Law of conservation of laws (p41)
- when the facts contradict the law, reject the facts or change the definitions, but never throw away the law

### Law of happy particularities (p42)
- any general law must have at least two specific applications

### Law of unhappy peculiarities (p42)
- any general law is bound to have at least two exceptions, or
- if you never say anything wrong, you never say anything

### The composition Law (p43)
- the whole is more than the sum of its parts

### The decomposition law (p43)
- the part is more than a fraction of the whole

### The banana principle (p55)
- heuristic devices don't tell you when to stop

### The Principle of Indifference (p72)
- laws should not depend on a particular choice of notation

### The Eye-Brain Law
- to a certain extent, mental power can compensate for observational weakness
- to a certain extent, observational power can compensate for mental weakness

### The Generalized Theromydnamics Law (p99-101)
- more probable states are more likely to be observed than less probable states, unless specific constraints exist to keep them from occurring
- the things we see more frequently are more frequent:
1. because there is some pysical reason to favor certain states (the First Law)
2. because there is some mental reason (the Second Law)

### The Lump Law (p105)
- If we want to learn anything, we mustn't try to learn everything

### The Generalized Law of Complementarity (p116)
- any two points of view are complementary

(a kind of generalization of the  uncertainty principle)

### Principle of Difference p140
- laws should not depend on a particular choice of symbols, but they usually do

### Axiom of experience p141
- The future will be like the past, because, in the past, the future was like the past

### The Principle of Invariance p154
- With respect to any given property, there are transformations that perserve it and those that do not
- With repsect to a given transformation, there are those properties that preserve it and those that do not preserve it
- We understand change only by observing thwta remains invariant, and permanence only by what is transformed

### Perfect Systems Law p160
- true systems properties cannot be investgiated

 p161
### The Strong Connection Law
- systems, on the average, are more tightly connected than the average
- a system is a collection of parts, no one of which can be changed
- in systems, all other things are rarely equal


p189

### The Picture principle
- When speaking about a dimensional reduction, insert the words "a picture of" in whatever you were about to say

p190

### The Diachronic Principle
- If a line of behavior crosses itself, then either
1. The system is not state detremined
2. we are viewing a projection - an incomplete view

p190

### The Syncrhonic Principles
- If two systems occupy the same position in the state space at the same time, then the space is underdimensioned, that is, the view is incomplete


p214

### The Principle of Indeterminability
- We cannot with certainty attribute observed constraint either to system or environment

217

### The Log-Log Law
- any set of data points forms a straight line fi plotted on log-log -paper

228

### Systems Triumvirate
1. Why do I see what I see?
2. Why do things stay the same?
3. Why do things change?

p251

### Law of Effect
- Small changes in structure usually lead to small changes in behavior
- Small changes in the white box usually lead to small changes in the black box
- Small changes in behavior will usually be found to result from small changes in structure

p254

### The Used Car Law
1. A system that is doing a good job of regulation need not adapt.
2. A system may adapt in order to simplify its job of regulating.

Restated:

1. A way of looking at the world that is not putting excessive stress on an observer need not be changed
2. A way of looking at the world may be changed to reduce the stress on an observer.
